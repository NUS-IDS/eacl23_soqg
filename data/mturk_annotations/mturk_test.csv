Yes, it may be unfair that women have to be more responsible with sex because it ultimately leads to pregnancy, however I'm sure if they waited to find out if the person they were dating was who they thought they were instead of having sex with them most likely for their looks they wouldn't be in the position they are in.

2,"They're denying special rights. It's a special right nobody else has but transgender people to use either restroom. Perhaps an understandable one, but nonetheless they still have the right to use a restroom as anybody else does - it may be more awkward for them because of their appearance though. The fact that trans people can use either restroom is sort of a necessary side effect of allowing them to use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity. The policy doesn't say ""only trans people can use whatever restroom they want,"" it says ""people can use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity."" This doesn't really apply to cis people, but cis people also have very little reason to want to use a different restroom in the first place. The alternative would be to say that trans people have to use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity, but that creates a host of other problems.

However, a group of people being hostile or unfair towards another group of people based on their skin color? That's an issue. Black people may portray racist behaviour on an individual level.

7,"Just to be absolutely clear, I'm not endorsing sex between children and adults. I think it should remain illegal (but that's not the view I'm looking to change today). I just think that calling it ""rape"" is a poor classification. That being said, here's some terms as i will be using them: Consent: a person willingly agreeing to have sex with another person. Rape: having sex with someone without their consent Statutory rape: an adult having sex with a minor who is young enough for it to be a criminal act. There are two main reasons I feel that we should stop referring to statutory rape as ""rape"", and should come up with a better, more descriptive term for it. The first is that it is not descriptive and dumbs down the conversation. If an adult has sex with a consenting minor, who is young enough that it is a crime, it doesn't really fit into the definition of rape. Unless you want to change the definition of ""consent"" to mean consent + a bunch of other things. It's simply not accurate. It's like referring to piracy as stealing they're both criminal acts, but not actually the same thing. The second reason is that it ignores the consent of the minor, which is important in determining whether the sex was rape. Imagine two scenarios: an adult has sex with a consenting minor, and an adult forces a minor into sex. If you use the ""statutory rape"" classification, you would just refer to both of these as the same crime statutory rape, ignoring the minor's consent. What would be more accurate would be to realize that in the second scenario two crimes were committed the adult having sex with a minor and also a rape. This kind of nuance, and the additional bad in the second scenario, is lost if it's just automatically classified as a rape. Change my view. EDIT: To everyone telling me what the legal definition of ""consent"" is, I think you're missing my point. I'm not arguing about the law defines consent and rape I'm arguing about how we should define consent and rape. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

16,"Hello there, my view is that Europe as a political entity (whether as the European Union, or as any of that Union's constituent states) is in a near irreversible decline and will be radically different within a hundred years. I have three major points that I feel suggest this outcome. 1. Less economic competition and fragmentation of consensus: With the various economic agreements that exist within the European Union's control that limit exports beyond the borders of the EU, countries that rely on outside foodstuffs and luxury products (mercantile states like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) are forced into a trading bloc that is constantly shrinking from within, yet dominate the import affairs of these mercantile countries. Although this, and treaties like that which brought the European Coal and Steel Community into being reduce the need for imperialism and conflict over limited resources, this does affect the value of these resources and the amount of money that can be made off of them. 2. Declining Military Might: A Hundred Years ago, European nations were the dominant military forces on the planet, with absurd power projection capabilities that allowed them to protect resources and bully colonized nations into submission. Today, All European Union military forces combined can barely match one of their former colonies, The United States, and one of the countries that they formerly dominated, China. Production of new Arms is largely a cooperative effort between the UK, Germany, and Italy. Of the former world powers, only France continues to design and construct all of their small arms, warplanes and naval ships completely independently. This (along with language barriers) would likely severely limit a pan-European defense effort if they were to be invaded by an outside force. 3. Declining Birthrates/Demographic Shift: The most important point, Most censuses of European populations indicate that most states in Europe cannot actually replace their populations through births alone, and are forced to rely on immigrants to make up the difference. Many of these immigrants come from former colonies and although they share common languages, they often have a different cultural flavour. Many immigrants to Europe are Muslim, speak Arabic (or Turkish) and are visibly in the minority when compared to the local populations. Most Europeans descend from white stock and have a Christianity-based (at least) worldview that is decidedly incompatible with that of Islam.",Why is it decidedly uncompatible with Islam?,reasons_evidence

20,"Not sure about the title but whatever I would like you to change my view on morals in general : I think morals are completely relative and thus any conversation on what is good and what is bad (such as politics, or veganism for example) presupposes that the people talking agree on the general moral system that is used. Since I don't think it is possible to prove that anything is objectively good, that there is no absolute moral reference that everyone could agree on (which means not based on faith as in religion for example), any system of moral principle is as good as any other and if I decide that good and bad don't exist at all, then I can do whatever I want, but I will not make me a bad person. I might get thrown in prison for disrupting the proper functionning of society, but it does not mean that what I did was morally reprehensible.

30,"Okay, we've found common ground. I agree with the WHO definition of violence. It is a physical action. Meaning that ideas and speech are not inherently violent. It is the actions that may come from these ideas/speech that is the violence. I also agree with the Canadian definition of hate speech except for 319.2. The part that says - ""(2) Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of (a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction."" This leaves it open for someone to define what ""hatred"" is. Who sets that definition? What if it's somebody you disagree with and they have a different definition of hatred than you? Is it not conceivable that this portion could be bastardized? The rest of the law is sound. It is a crime if the speech/threat will lead to a breach of the peace and result in violence. It is NOT a crime if there is no action to go along with the speech.

I'm becoming increasingly concerned with the mainstreaming of the sexualization of children, and this drag kids movement in public seems (to me) to be contributing to a normalization of it. Makeup and dresses are fine, but introducing children to drag culture in public is not, as drag is inherently sexualized (wearing lingerie and very skimpy outfits, sexually dancing on other people, etc. ), not to mention the drug culture it is intertwined with. For example, this kid desmond is amazing (keep in mind he's 11) has been in photoshoots with naked people in wigs, he's danced on stage at bars while grown men threw money at him, he was in a live video with a drag queen and when someone commented about ketamine in the chat, he immediately knew what it was and pretended to snort off his arm as a joke (to which the drag queen laughed). By far the most disturbing was when he was in a video interview, nodding off and not remembering questions next to a convicted murderer who chopped a man to pieces after murdering him by putting drain-o in his veins, Michael Alig. There was even a painting michael painted in the back of the video interview of a little girl skipping rope with the word rohypnol (date rape drug) next to her.

By my understanding, a “race realist” is somebody who believes that races have inherent differences. From that premise, a “race realist” will usually draw some conclusions about why some races are more “successful” than others, and why races should be separated and insulated from one another. They tend to also believe that interracial mixing and multiculturalism are equivalent to genocide. But I recognize that these inferences are not universal to those who follow the core premise that the races are just fundamentally different from each other, even if (just judging from my own personal experiences) 90% of “race realists” jump to those conclusions. My argument is that even the core premise of racial difference is racist. Even if “race realists” don’t explicitly say that those differences are positive or negative, that conclusion is inferred from history and the ongoing process of globalization. If you believe that racial differences exist as inherent traits, you cannot believe those differences exist in a vacuum separate from the context of the world we live in the unspoken logical implication behind every “race realist” is that the races that enjoy success under the current world order are inherently better because of their race, while those who have been marginalized or exploited are inherently worse. The conclusion that inherent racial differences are reflected in history ignores every other political or economic factor at play in creating those outcomes. This is really no different from a racist who just explicitly says that their race is better than any other race.

Micro 101 and Macro 101 will not cover these nuances because it is a 101 course. The marxist applications to behavioral economics will not be covered because it's a 101 course. Debt: The First 5000 Years is written by an anthropologist not an economist. Site a book economists actually look at, like ""Why Nations Fail"" or ""The bottom billion"" and you get a picture that is worth something. I am sure Debt is a wonderful anthropologist piece, but it is a terrible piece for economic commentary. ""Teach the controversy."" Economics is mathematical. The mathematics follow a free market system over a central system, but can be applied to both. We don't teach creation theory in a biology classroom, because it is incorrect. Marxist theory in economics is largely irrelevant now, and study after study is confirming it. That is not to say marx is entirely useless. Some applications of marx work is showing up in developmental economics and behavioral economics, within the normal framework.

How would value be determined? Currency or bartering? What would need to be done to replace the current system with the new one? Second question. How do you end Labour, at least physical labour? Automation? That would cost, unless its in a socialist utopian society, which already would need to be achieved first, and then such implementation put in place. Aside from eerily resembling the plot of animal farm, any incentive of working on such a project would be the gaining of freedom later on, which for the time being, makes sense. So it would be likely that many people would work on such a project to its completion. Could such a project be actually completed? Automation of manual jobs(construction, agriculture, factories, etc.) Could very well be automated, and are already highly so, just with human supervision. And why would people stop there? What would prevent people from trying to anihilate other forms of labour? Third question. How would you enforce such a system? How would you enforce a system in which no one works?

Of course, the religious and historical connection of Jews to that specific territory would have made it very difficult to locate Israel anywhere else. Nonetheless, my own opinion is that Israel should have been moved to Australia in 1948, where it could have existed as a peaceful neighbor to the existing Australians, without war or terrorism. I have even gone so far as to suggest that it is still not too late to relocate Israel, although this suggestion is always met with extreme revulsion as a complete impossiblity. I think there is just a lack of vision. Israel is very far from being the largest piece of land that has historically changed hands in a commercial transaction remember the Louisiana Purchase, or the purchase of Alaska. Vast territories, roughly a hundred times larger than Israel, have been bought and sold in the past. What if, rather than fighting to the last drop of blood over the ownership of this relatively small piece of land, it is put on the market? Of course, Palestinians are not wealthy, but the Saudis, or the United Arab Emirates, are quite wealthy. The money exists.

The idea would be that someone at the bottom who knows that they are at the bottom might find any arrangement unjust, and someone at the top who knows that they are at the top might find any arrangement tolerable. In reality, however, our social roles are not mere biases, but lenses. We do not know what life is like for an undocumented immigrant desperately trying to feed a family with a backbreaking job while on the run from the police for daring to pick the fruit they eat, even knowing full well that all of society is predicated on us picking that fruit at slave wages.

Do you think it is underfunded on the basis of race, or do you think there are other factors? Race is the primary one. Black wealth in america is ridiculously lower than white wealth. Combine that with historical practices like redlining, and you get poor districts and rich districts that are basically racially segregated. Not by law, but by history. This doesn't mean that every white student attends a good school and every black student a bad one, but the effects are disproportionate. A perfect solution would be to understand every individual students K-12 education trajectory, and know the status and opportunities each student had. That's also generally economically infeasible. You have to discriminate some how, either you ignore those factors and have ""race blind"" admissions, which has the effect of discriminating against black students who didn't have equal opportunity, or you do take race, as one (of a number of, economic status is another proxy that should be used) proxy, for opportunity, in your admissions process.",So the better alternative is assuming a student is at a disadvantage simply because they are black?,assumptions

Let's name them hard and soft agnosticism for simplicity. Hard agnosticism is as you define it. It is a claim that requires warrant. We aren't discussing hard agnosticism. So if I do use the term outside of the paragraph, I mean soft agnosticism. Soft agnosticism is the belief/though/position that you do not know. But by arguing the semantics here, you missed my point. I was saying that your first section discussed ""atheism"" as a neutral position that has no burden of proof (Later, I did take issue as to whether you actually did this). But while your first section held that atheism makes no claims, your second section made claims about naturalism (and therefore atheism) being true. There are gnostic atheists, rare though they are, and agnostic deists. There's no contradiction there. I don't like to use these terms for two reasons. 1. Gnosticism is a separate thing and can cause confusion. 2. You are really discussing how a person views two issues: the ability to know god, and the existence of god. I don't know if we really need these compound phrases on two unrelated issues. Yes, we can describe a person by all the proper adjectives of their beliefs, but it can bring red herrings from one issue into the discussion of the other. And while it is not contradictory, it is conflicting to be agnostic (in your hard sense) and take a position of knowledge/belief such as deism. It is conflicting within the person even though no statements are self-contradictory. Let's talk about default positions. It is important to note that this is an issue in rhetoric.

I live in the area and can count the number of black Fettes students I've seen on one hand. James Bond is a reflection of the upper crust of the British establishment - that's not a group one would call diverse. If you did insist on a black Bond, I still wouldn't cast Idris Elba. He's far too heavily associated with characters like Luther. Bond is high class, someone like Chiwetel Ejiofor carries that a lot better than Elba. I put characters like Batman, Spiderman, and James Bond in that category. They are more than just characters now, they're myths Except Batman and Spiderman aren't characters - they're identities, they're masks - Bond, on the other hand, is a character. Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker are characters but we can still have Batman and Spiderman without them because someone else can take up the mantle. If you want a Spiderman film with a black lead then go with Miles Morales as Spidey instead of Peter Parker.

I know there are plenty of good arguments against the bill, but I am just focusing on the oft stated: six weeks is before many women know they are pregnant. Let me start by being a bit crude: if a guy cums in you, you might be pregnant. While sure, a woman could wait 2 or 3 months to naturally see if they are pregnant and abort the child. They could get a pregnancy test, especially knowing they are going to have to get an abortion within six weeks. The same clinic that they would end up going to have an abortion have free or cheap pregnancy tests. To me, if a guy cums in me it's doesn't seem like undue burden for me to buy a $10 dollar pregnancy test from Walmart or get a free one from a clinic. There are even clinics that offer plan b for free. It's going to be easier on my body and mind to get an abortion earlier than later anyway.

I am against it because I feel that the sexual act is healthy only if it is pleasurable, intimate and consensual. Sex between two people who are not in an existing romantic relationship (that's how I define casual sex) may be pleasurable and consensual, but it is definitely not intimate. In addition, the fact that sexual activity can lead humans to form emotional bonds with each other can lead to dangerous consequences (unhappiness and a lack of fulfillment) if people sleep with others whose personalities they may not be able to accept. If we were emotionless creatures, I would have no problems with casual sex. But the truth is that most humans are unable to separate their minds from their bodies. In addition, there are several disadvantages to casual sex. Firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is 'clean'. Protection can be used, but honestly, no form of protection is 100% effective. Secondly, it is unproductive and time-wasting, and can lead to other even more unproductive and costly behaviors like binge drinking and internet addiction (browsing hookup sites). Sex by itself is not unproductive or a waste of time (because of the intimacy factor, as explained previously), but meaningless sex is. Thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk-taking behavior. When we condone one aspect of risk-taking behavior, such as casual sex, we also condone other forms of risk-taking behavior, such as drugs and gambling. The 'thrill' of unknown partners can easily manifest itself in other vices. Right now, the world is completely fine with casual sex (apart from conservatives and religious people).

But that's what is happening. Since the diabetes analogy I mentioned previously didn't do it for you - allow me another that I think demonstrates what is really going on. Let's say a person comes to the Emergency Room with respiratory failure due to sepsis from pneumonia. They are unconscious from their illness and unable to speak. Without treatment - they will die within 24 hours. This person does not have medical decision making capacity it is my moral and professional obligation to treat the patient. Now, there is another patient with severe depression to the point of wanting to commit suicide. It is the disease (depression) that imposes this pathological compulsion on them. And so, they do not have medical decision making capacity. If we don't treat this person - they will be dead within 24 hours. If we do treat them, their symptom (suicidal ideation) will go away and they will live a long and healthy life. I understand that it's difficult to empathize with the idea that a disease can take away your ability to think clearly and make decisions particularly if you've never experienced it or seen it.

In a thought experiment, if two universes that were identical in every single aspect were to exist, with the exact same interactions, no interference with each other whatsoever, they would play out exactly the same. Even quantum uncertainty would be determined, as I argue that the uncertainty is caused by the physical limits of observation on such a scale. Yet on this micro scale it would play out the exact same way in the twin universes, regardless of whether they can be observed. Then the micro-scale would influence the macroscale, which in a butterfly effect style would affect other stuff.

Free will in the sense that choices we make are made something that isn't just a set output from a set input is false. Our consciousness is an illusion considering that we are within finite system of interactions and a larger system, for example a supercomputer could have the potential to completely predict one person's thoughts and actions 100% accurately given the all of the finite number of variables that influence us within our finite system.

If someone kills someone else, they deserve to experience in excruciating, visceral detail the emotion associated with entering the void for the rest of eternity - and then the emotional pain that all the loved ones that the deceased are going through. If someone robs someone else, they deserve to experience the sense of loss - both in monetary value and emotional/physical security - that their victim experienced. (Read: the sense of loss in monetary value, the ""oh shit I lost x% of my income"" feeling - not actual loss. The sense of loss of emotional/physical security.) Ideally, in some far-future society where we could force people to experience emotion, a just form of punishment would be to first have the criminal experience all negative emotion associated with their crime, and then go through a period of rehabilitation from which they are not released until their personality has changed (this far-future society would have the capability to determine if their personality has changed enough). Even if we had (and were willing to use) technology capable of ""redeeming"" a criminal and changing their personality for the better, it is still just for them to experience the magnitude of the crime they committed. ---- ### Thoughts The reason I ask this is that the concept of proportional punishment seems to be reviled and thought of as fundamentally wrong.",And what if we go to far in enacting this eye for an eye punishment?,implication_consequences

Thus, they study for the SATs, many student (including mine), from elementary and middle school. That means these students are studying for six or seven years for a test that will or will not get them into an American school. A couple things happen as a consequence that I believe makes it not only OK, but responsible for American schools to hold Asian students to a higher standard. One is that they've spent years studying for a test, but did not spent as much (in some cases not nearly as much) time in subjects that would actually help them graduate. I'm very close to a few professors in UW and UNLV, and there are stories of Korean and Chinese students who aced the SATs but cannot understand enough spoken English to get through a single lecture, and have no idea how to write a research paper. Then there's cheating. Last year was one of the years where, in Korea, the SAT canceled tests, because cheaters were caught. But most of the time they aren't caught. In fact there is a business in these Asian countries of buying responses to college admission essays, because most (I'd say all, because that's my experience) students who apply to American colleges pay other people to write their admission essay. Obviously, these universities would benefit a lot from adopting a different system for these ""highly motivated"" students - a series of personal or online interviews and a more randomized (less predictable than the SAT) test.

If Bernie runs and you vote for him, you're practically voting for his VP more than anything because the odds of Bernie Sanders falling ill or getting badly injured will just keep increasing drastically as he grows older in that role. In addition to his health, voting for him again will show that in the last four years Democrats have been unable to push out a younger candidate that can be just as popular.

How then do we deal with eventual abberance? If a murder is committed in a stateless society, what is done? In order to maintain consistency within a general non-aggression philosophy, we would simply have to allow it. We would have to either consistently permit the abrogation of rights or temporarily abandon non-aggression to stop a person who violated rights. In my view, this is why NAP is a flawed concept. It rejects the legitimacy of aggression while conceding that violence is necessary to protect from aggression.

For those interested, here is the full definition What Is Capitalism? Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals or businesses own capital goods. The production of goods and services is based on supply and demand in the general market—known as a market economy—rather than through central planning—known as a planned economy or command economy. The purest form of capitalism is free market or laissez-faire capitalism. Here, private individuals are unrestrained. They may determine where to invest, what to produce or sell, and at which prices to exchange goods and services. The laissez-faire marketplace operates without checks or controls. Today, most countries practice a mixed capitalist system that includes some degree of government regulation of business and ownership of select industries. Thats right, crony capitalism is not free market capitalism. Regulations is not free market capitalism. Social programs is not free market capitalism. Charity is part of free market capitalism.

For example, how does a private security force keep from devolving into a mafia for hire if their only responsibility is to a private customer? We complain under statism about corrupt police officers being loyal to the people lining their pockets instead of the public, but wouldn't a private security force work that way by design? Competition. Right now there is a monopoly police force which takes your money by force and is not accountable to you in the slightest. If there are multiple firms that compete for your business, they lack the incentive to go off the rails, unlike how the current police is militarizing. If a private police force is lining their pockets instead of doing the services they are paid to do, customers can take their business elsewhere. What happens to the person who can't afford private rights enforcement? Are they fair game as a target for crime? Charity is of course one way. The main gist is that in a free society, without the government doing its best to keep poor people poor, and the cost of goods and services coming down because that's what the market does, there would be fewer poor people who would need charity in the first place. Other ways could be that Rights Agency A says ""would you like to pay an extra $5 a year to help the Johnson's get security? It's a much more direct form of charity.

You need it well separated from everything else, which means distance, fences, security and containment buildings. Nuclear is also complicated by nature. It needs smart, well paid people running it.

The parts are made by the million which works great with mass production technologies, and many can be made in general purpose factories.
