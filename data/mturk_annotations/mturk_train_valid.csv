0,"I’m a vegetarian and would hate to eat either. But I’ve seen several news articles recently about campaigners trying to pressure China and other Asian countries into banning the killing and consumption of dogs. To me, there is no moral difference between the two. I find it paradoxical to be in favour of killing and eating pigs and cows, but not dogs.

1,"By our current standards, a child is just as likely to see a Jedi kill a guy with a lightsaber- and anthropomorphic animals without any clothes on. Consider the degrees removed from realism. Breasts, alien or not, is pretty close to real breasts, and they are real if it's live-action. Comparatively, a lightsaber is far less real than a sword, and it's definitely less real than actual exposed onscreen breasts.",How is that different from a real sword in any meaningful way?,clarity
2,"Christianity, as I understand it, teaches that we all deserve hell. God is perfect and holy and all people have sinned against him and rejected him. Because of this sin, all people have separated themselves from God, by doing their will instead of his. Jesus died to take the punishment for these sins and reconcile us to God. No one deserves this gift, and it is by God's grace that anyone is saved. Therefore, it's not unjust for anyone to go to hell, it is what we all deserve. This presupposes a very Western, modern understanding of justice and the individual. Not everyone would disregard our collective guilt. While we all are predisposed to sin, indeed some Christians would say every single thing we do is tainted by sin, we also have free will. Even if you disregarded 99% of our sin, every single person has used their free will to intentionally break God's laws. I'd also add that apart from God there can be no objective morality, other than what is right in our own eyes, which isn't really the same thing. edit: formatting - sorry for the yelling!",Why are you yelling?,others

Some kind of major sickness is a burden for everyone involved and if you have the option to get rid of that burden, some people will make that choice. If you are in a position that you would rather cut ties than help your boyfriend/girlfriend through a tough diagnosis, then if you were shamed into staying it would only harm the relationship further and it would be harder to deal with down the road for both parties.",Are you assuming every time someone gets sick they will necessarily become so aggressive about keeping the relationship together that they will become abusive?,assumptions

10,"Most of the responses on this topic have been less combative let me emphasize that I want to have a logical, relatively emotionless discussion on this topic and that my thoughts are not set in stone. Certainly not all the time, like with most things there are rare occurrences where they don't at all. And you shouldn't write these events off because they are ""rare"". As trans people are rare as well. In the rare case that a woman has no breast tissue, she has other elements of female biology. This usually causes significant distress and she'll be medically treated or have breast construction surgery, like a trans woman might have. So what if they have low estrogen and high testosterone? I can pull up examples of these people if needed, just look at women athletes. Does that make them men? Good question, but no, a woman with low estrogen and high testosterone has other biological elements of being a woman. A few of your other points of women's biology can be addressed this way. Also, a woman faces a certain upbringing and socialization, so a woman who has absolutely no breasts, low estrogen and high testosterone, and no uterus/female genitalia from, perhaps, a hysterectomy, will have been raised as a woman. My argument is that until a trans woman has spent some time coping with those social forces, she doesn't understand what it is to be a woman. The social forces change in different cultures, so I'm focusing mostly on western culture. In western culture men are strongly encouraged not to cry or show vulnerable emotion. Women are allowed to cry on the other hand. A trans woman may not understand that until she's lived it.",So why are you implying trans women have to face this sexism?,reasons_evidence

12,"That is a poor analogy. A ""Christian system of government"" would be illegal in the US and no one believes that the US is a Christian government. The analogy is apt, a two-party system would also be illegal in the US, and there is, in fact, a steady stream of politicians claiming that America is a Christian nation founded on Christian teachings. Rot Moore, among others, are on record as saying that Muslims and atheists should not be allowed to hold public office. While it's true that the overwhelming majority of politicians are both Christian and members of one of two political parties, the system itself is neither Christian nor two-party. The system is not officially two-party but it is for all practical purposes. It's not. It's not even close. There are several (mostly communist) countries that have one-party systems. There are other countries like Singapore that have a system based on a small number of approved parties. The US system looks nothing like any of them. Our legal and governmental systems are specifically designed so that religion and party affiliation is irrelevant. The systems have failed miserably at the latter. ... and until a few decades ago at the former as well. That's why it's so important to understand that we do not live in a two-party system even though almost all politicians are members of one of those parties.",Why do you think the two parties want the current system to continue?,reasons_evidence

19,"Okay, so I have had this theory building up over the last ten years or so as I have been going through school and getting degrees in different areas. I can go to school for free and I like to learn. I've studied history, ecology, politics, health and public safety, art and psychology. I'm by no means an expert in any of them but I'm well-versed enough to talk about all of them. I've seen a trend that in every field, the general stressor or causal issue in each is overpopulation. The exponential growth of the human race causes structural failure in on a local, regional, national and global scale. The only way to begin the trend back towards a sustainable global environment is for people to just stop having children. Below are the top five global issues listed as worries for Europeans from a poll taken in 2011. I couldn't find an updated one for the US that I trusted. With them I've laid out the very very very light framework of how population control could benefit. No deep details, just an overview of my opinion. Global Warming/Ecological Impact: Love it or hate it, humans take a major toll on natural resources without heeding the impact it takes on the earth as a complete system. If there was a concerted effort to keep the population from growing for even a decade, or indefinitely limiting the number of offspring allowed to be born, it would curb the toll taken on natural resources as well as lessen the footprint we're leaving as a species. On top of that, the industrial complex that is needed to support a growing population must continually make riskier and riskier decisions on how to keep they supply meeting demand. This means rather than dumping their waste in a safe place, it's going to rivers and oceans so that they can keep production up. Rather than finding sustainable ways to transport goods, their profits are going toward scaling the business rather than researching sustainability.

I'd argue I'm using the socratic method. I also think ""being passive aggressive in a thread in which I specifically sought replies"" doesn't meet any reasonable definition of harassment.

23,"Without having this stumble into any area of racism, I want to make it clear that I'm not focusing on any country. If these wet markets are more dangerous than nuclear weapons, we should have an international treaty type of document that says no one will do business with any country where wet markets are legal and or permitted. Without drawing any parallels to any other types of international documents, I just think we should make it very clear that these types of practices and lack of hygiene have international ramifications. I wish I had some historical references to show that doing something like this is highly effective but I can only think about the European dark ages and how they figured out that maybe not throwing shit and animal entrails everywhere was possibly causing all the problems. There was a Renaissance shortly after... so maybe this is our opportunity for an International Renaissance?

24,I've held this view for quite sometime and I'm hoping you all can test its veracity: In today's vernacular political correctness is a term used to describe communication that unnecessarily seeks to avoid offending people. The people who use it most frequently want it to either undermine criticism of themselves (such as dismissing criticism of their own prejudiced communications as being unnecessarily fussy) or use it to undermine communications they don't like (eg attacking liberal initiatives that seek to supplant conservative values).,Why assume people use it for selfish and reason of personal benefit?,assumptions
25,"I believe that if something has been thrown away, then it has zero value to the previous owner, and that if you can get positive value out of it, taking it makes the world a better place. Therefore, it is moral to do so, and most laws against the practice should be abolished. Caveats: 1. Trespassing is often wrong. Going into a dumpster when people are trying to discard heavy things could be dangerous. However, this obviously does not apply to a trash collecter since she would be accessing the dumpster anyway. And for regular people, much/most dumpster diving can be done safely and without trespassing. 2. Some disposal is not really ""trash"". If someone collects used cooking oil to sell, then that is not really trash - taking it would be theft. My argument only applies to things which a trash collector would take for free or would be paid to take. 3. If information gathering is wrong (Identity theft, etc) then gathering it via trash collection is still wrong. 4. If you are the employee of a trash collection agency, and your employer demands certain types of trash, such as recycleables, then the employer has the right to them.

Even if you do catch it and suffer nothing, you could transmit it to someone who is at serious risk of dying/permanent damage.

There is variability within all traits, yes. But there are still two distinct categories, influenced to an extent by biology. Sex hormones and sex chromosomes have an undeniable effect on the physical and mental traits you exhibit, cross-culturally. This is proven. Males on average are more interested in things, in science and mathematics. Females are more interested in people, in artistic and social elements. This is not a social construct. If gender was just a social construct, what we would see as we move toward egalitarian societies is that gender differences minimize. But the OPPOSITE holds true in Scandinavia, some of the most egalitarian societies in the world, gender differences maximize. As men and women are presented equal opportunity to pursue whichever career path they want, more men than women choose STEM degrees. This directly refutes your claim that gender is a social construct. The goal is not conformity. The goal is to figure out the root of GD. Because the way we treat GD has implications on non-GD people.

All single use/limited use products should be changed to compostable (not just biodegradable) or other easily recyclable alternatives like aluminium.

As someone who lives in New Zealand, although you are an entire ocean away from us your country's news about minorities having to actually fight for their rights to freedom making it to our mainstream news as well as all the injustices that occur is insane.

The simple fact that racial atrocities in the US can be so bad as to make it to the news around the entire WORLD should be something of concern. I have no doubt that there is a majority of Americans who are anti-racist, I have to agree there. My personal understanding of it is that there are more and more people being born AFTER the abolition of racist laws (post MLK I would say?) leads to a wider acceptance of diversity as the norm as they were brought up with it being entirely normal, and in contrast the population of older generations who were brought up, more likely with the belief that whites are superior, brown is inferior etc. Is shrinking as time goes on. However, this does not mean that these ideologies can easily be passed down. It is up to the individual to make the conscience realisation that there is nothing worthy of hate in one's culture or skin color.

So that's the core disagreement and the reason why drugs are not legalized. One might argue, and I will, that the harm from people having easy and virtually unrestricted access to drugs, like in North America right now, is the cause of massive problems within the society. In other words, the cost of having more people do drugs trumps the negative effects of drug control (law enforcement, mafia, people thrown into jails). The deterrent (throwing people into jails) is unfair and cruel, but it's worth it. For someone who lives in Asia, it's quite shocking to go to the US and see how people there are lazy, not working, behaving erratically, staff in a restaurant being high AF, and so on.

45,"The stated mission of police is to ""serve and protect"" the people, and obviously from what we've seen recently in the news this mission is being strayed from. I am against the idea that police should be especially respected and revered as it contributes to their own idea that their lives matter more than those of the citizenry. What this has led to is a police culture of being able to take a human life at the first sign that an officer's life is in danger, even remotely. If a person is actually committed to being a benevolent protector of the public, he or she should be willing to take a greater personal risk in being that protector. It is my view that many officers should be disarmed of the ability to use lethal force - guns should only be carried under circumstances in which there is an actual chance of having to draw them in a fight for one's life i.e. police are going after a known dangerous individual. This would undoubtedly lead to an increase in officers not being able to brandish a lethal weapon in situations where they previously would have. Some police officers would die where they wouldn't have before. But many fewer unnecessary civilian deaths would occur. In my opinion, cops being lethally armed and authorized to take lethal action whenever they feel threatened is not worth the cost we have been witnessing where many avoidable civilian deaths occur. I think it is somewhat tragic that carrying a gun is what in many ways defines what an American police officer is - someone with the ability to kill at any time should they feel it is necessary. In an ideal world where our culture did not dictate that police carry guns I think it would be great if every morning individual officers made a reasonable choice as to whether or not they would need a gun that day for whatever reason.

Main Point After my deletion of Instagram, and a creation of a new one for only my closest friends whom I trust aren't toxic gossipers, of 50 followers, new people I meet immediately notice my lack of presence on Instagram and I know that they judge me for it even though they don't tell me it. People my age ask each other's Instagram almost as a compulsory rule of thumb and I'm always the only one with such a significantly small number of followers. Either that or I don't feel comfortable enough to share my Instagram with them as we aren't close. I'm not a weirdo nor a social outcast, I have close friends I talk to on a very regular basis.

I think this right to life necessarily extends to viable foetuses regardless of whether or not their life is comparable to that of a born and developed person, because they too have a future of value. My caveats are for non-viable foetuses, as mentioned above and who have no prospect of a future of value, and for threats to the mother's life, which can be justified on the same grounds of self-defense.",Are you implying you would be fine with some system of abortion that simply shut down the sustenance the woman is providing instead of actively destroying the pregnancy?,implication_consequences

Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals spread the disease at exactly the same rate. Taking the vaccine has minimal impact Maybe, maybe not.

Also, certain groups are significantly more at risk for side effects from the vaccines themselves then they are from covid, most notably young boys. They're far more likely to die from myocarditis than they are to die from a covid infection. Nothing about having had COVID prevents you from also having the vaccine, so get it. That's true, but nothing about the vaccine actually helps someone who already has natural immunity. The absolute risk reduction from dying of covid is absolutely miniscule compared to the risk of complications from the vaccine itself, especially since people who already have natural immunity have stronger reactions to the vaccines. vaccines boost the effects of natural immunity You're trying to base this on the cdc's highly dubious claim that the relative risk reduction over natural immunity is 50%.

The most vital component of any set of beliefs is that they are aligned in their foundational principles, or at the very least are not contradictory in their foundational principles. You can endlessly debate surface-level ""results"" of a belief, you can find statistics to back every side of every debate, you can spin statistics, give anecdotes, talk in circles ad infinitum. It is so rare that there is so much evidence that we all can agree ""yes, this was correct/incorrect"". The only ones that can come to mind are National Socialism is bad and Communism is bad, but even then there is plenty of debate, especially surrounding the latter. I'll give two common examples of these contradictory beliefs in action, as they are subjects that I have experience with and enjoy debating: A woman has the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, due to her right to bodily integrity/autonomy, meaning their right to self-determination -- AND -- Medical professionals should be compelled to perform the procedure under threat of legal action. These are two principles that conflict. The woman should retain the right of self determination through the right to choose, even in the case that the pregnancy is the result of choice and pure negligence or carelessness (i.e. no contraceptive measures taken) but the medical professional does not retain their right of self determination because they have chosen to become medical professionals. In one case, there is no condition under which the right to self determination is surrendered, in another, there is.

There have also been studies indicating that developmental factors also play a large part in whether or not a person turns out to be gay, particularly in men. In this case, ""developmental"" refers to the conditions under which a fetus develops in the womb. In particular, a study by Blanchard and Klassen (1997) indicated that for each older brother a particular man has, his likelihood of being gay increases by 33%. One theory that has been proposed to explain this is that male fetuses provoke an immune response in the mother that gets stronger with each subsequent male fetus.

Changing the laws around contracting sexual labor could eliminate some of the ambiguity that has led to the Me Too movement while allowing women to benefit economically from the demand for sex with females. Here are the points of my argument: 1. Romantic relationships happen all the time in the workplace. These relationships affect employment decisions. This will not change and any attempts to regulate these romantic relationships will push them further into the shadows, further disempowering women. 2. The key is to distinguish romantic relationships from sexual relationships. There is overlap, but these relationships are different. My argument deals with sexual relationships, which may or may not be romantic relationships. 3. Men currently hold a disproportionate share of global capital and power.

Now I want to make it clear that I do actually tip, but it doesn't sit well with me: why should contract drivers be tipped for competent service? I can understand why wait staff gets tipped--their legal wage can be as low as $3. I still think it's bullshit that customers are expected to supplement a restaurant employee's subpar pay as opposed to the owner paying a living wage, but whatever. My not tipping some poor single mother isn't going to suddenly change a social custom. I don't see the rationale for tipping rideshare drivers, though. As contractors, they are self-employed and can thus walk away from Uber of Lyft if they don't feel that the rate is good enough. If I made you wait, or had a hard to find address, or you did something that went above and beyond, then yeah, makes sense to tip you.

But 20 million is a different ball game. Not only do you have to acquire 20 million fucking trees, but also you need to distribute those trees to volunteers who will plant the trees that you will have had to acquire beforehand for the tree planting project. Simply put, this project is simply too massive to be done with only 20 million dollars.

Technically Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's family has resided in the US roughly as long as Trump's (Puerto Rico became part of the US in 1898, and Trump's grandfather immigrated in 1885). However, it's certainly in character for Trump to not be aware of this, as it would require some amount of research on his part. The information that is in front of his face is people's last names. Obama, Omar, and Tlaib are not thought of as ""American-sounding"" names. There are records of Muslims in the US dating back to before the American Revolution, but they were a very small percentage of the population (~0.1%) until the 1970's. Pressley is a pretty established American last name (brought over from the English), but Trump didn't specifically call out Ayanna Pressley in his tweet. He may have not been considering her when writing his tweets. I would argue that Cortez is an established American last name as well, since the US took over huge chunks of Mexico in the early 1800's. Again, Trump is not particularly knowledgeable nor does he seem to have much desire to learn things. He's from New York, where immigration from Latin America is relatively new compared to immigration from Germany or Ireland. To him, Cortez is not a traditional American last name.

It requires snap decision-making by the players. You're the second baseman, with runners on first and third, and you dive for a ground ball. Do you send it home and stop the run? Try for a double play yourself? Get it to the shortstop? Go to first for the out and then home? The players have to sort through all of these decisions in a split-second and act on them. 2. Players have to be good at both offense and defense. Unlike football, where there's two separate teams, and hockey, where defenders hang back, baseball players all have to be able to field, throw, hit, and run well to be an effective member of the team. This means that players have to be diverse in their skills, since they all have to contribute to both sides of the game. 3. It's incredibly strategic. It may not be obvious, but baseball is a deep, strategic game.

We generally hold you responsible for killing someone, but we don't charge you for murder every time someone dies of malnutrition who you could have potentially fed. Responsibility of the parent - a 37 year old is legally just some rando to the parents, unlike small children. By the same token, you can charged for neglecting to care for a small child, but not for your adult children (generally). Fault - we might reasonably say that it's the parents fault that the fetus is dependent on the mother for survival, but since a rare disease can't reasonably be forseen, the parents are not at fault. On the other hand, everyone knows a fetus requires its mother to survive, and so the dependency is easily forseen. We generally ascribe higher obligations for people who are at fault in a situation than not at fault. someone's body is being used against their will to keep another person alive, surely if abortion is just about the rights of the fetus to life being more important than ones right to bodily autonomy, then the same conclusions about what the law should be will apply here.","If she was driving drunk, would it then be ok to force her to give up her bodily autonomy to save the son?",implication_consequences

For sex, it's easy to explain, chromosomes. For gender it seems not so definitive. Chromosomes aren't what define sex. They're one thing that may be used in determining sex, along with hormone levels, secondary sex characteristics, and gametes produced. High school biology isn't accurate when it comes to complicated topics. Gender identity is defined in terms of gender No, it isn't.

A meaningful interaction of ideas cannot occur in an environment where information is not memorized. Externalization of information inhibits meaningful and spontaneous conversation, and leads one to hold contradictory opinions without any sense of cognitive dissonance. The art of conversation also suffers: compare any dialogue in a nineteenth century novel to modern conversation - clearly something is amiss here. Language is becoming less artistic and more pragmatic - metaphor and wit are unnecessary when information is externalized in an infinitely available form. 3: Ambiguity and distance are the most fundamental incentives for intellectual and psychological growth.

280,"A lot of people don't understand the legal position of Roe v. Wade, and this opinion stems from such a misunderstanding. In the US, the default position for the government is that it has no ability to pass any law. To pass a law, the government needs to be able to point to a constitutional provision that gives it the authority to do so. Every state constitution, as well as the Federal constitution, contain a provision that allows for the government to regulate ""the health, safety, and well being"" of society - this is known as the police power. So, for example, theft harms the health, safety, or well being of society. Because of that, the government can cite its police power as granting it the authority to pass a law regulating theft - IE by criminalizing it. The government's ability to regulate abortion stems from its police power (or lack thereof). When humans die that causes harm to the health, safety, or well being of society and thus the state is able to regulate the death of humans. The question then is when is a fetus a human. Before a fetus becomes a human, it has no special significance and removing a fetus from the body is legally no different than removing a tumor. But once a fetus becomes a human the state's police power grants it an interest in protecting that fetus from being killed. And this is ultimately what Roe v. Wade is about - it doesn't grant any right to get an abortion. Rather, it defines the point at which a human becomes a human being and thus the police power grants the state the ability to protect it from being killed. But this is a balancing act, because the police power is something that the state uses to benefit society as a whole.

There are also fields where women, on average, make less than men. Which is the vast majority of hte case.

314,"Advances in medicine by doctors and researches have prevented and alleviated human disease and suffering to an incredible degree - we should all be very thankful for medical science. At the same time, they have left behind a long trail of mistakes that have caused untold suffering due to counter-productive procedures and recommendations. The examples of this are too numerous to even skim the surface, from lobotomies to widely used medications being pulled only after they've caused tremendous damage. For that reason, I think it's reasonable to question doctors and medical science. Often doctors are not that familiar with all the risks of their recommendations, either because those risks are still unknown or because they don't have time to keep up with the literature. For a pretty mild but recent example, how about all the doctors that recommended Zantac for acid reflux, which was recently pulled due to cancer-causing properties? If your doctor had recommended it, you might have been better off addressing the issue on your end, perhaps even looking to (gasp!) alternative health resources for remedies. Maybe those same doctors will now recommend to you a different medication for reflux -- the category called PPIs, like Prilosec and Nexium, are very popular. Maybe you go against your doctor's advise and hop on Google, despite all the warnings that ""Google is no replacement for medical training! "" (it's not, but it sure can help). Maybe you see that more and more research is linking PPIs to a host of ailments (perhaps they'll be pulled at a later date?). ""Hey, why didn't my doctor tell me this?"" It wasn't long ago that Western medical science had some pretty barbaric practices. We were still diagnosing ""hysteria"" in women and performing shock therapy until relatively recently. Homosexuality was still a ""disorder"" in 1986. I don't think we've turned some theoretical corner.

Only 32% of healthcare spending is in hospital care. That's still alot of cost, but if you want universal coverage, this is the only way to do it without bankrupting the federal government. Hospitalization and emergency work is the only major reason why people feel they have to have insurance. That's an immediate cost that they can't pay and one of the main reasons that 60 percent of all bankruptcies in the us come from medical bills. So if you were to publicly fund just that option, then two things would happen. One is that people could have a greater freedom to not pay for insurance if they think, based on their health, that the premiums over time will be more expensive than the actual preventative/regular health work that they are likely to require. That's what happens when you take the massive, immediate, financial risk out of requiring hospitalization. This would also force premiums lower due to the insurance company not having as much leverage over the consumer. The second thing is that it would open up the opportunity for private insurance companies to lower their premiums naturally because of competition, a loss of leverage and the lack of exposure to the risk of hospitalization. Since the government would be paying for it, the risk is not on the consumer or the insurance company. I believe this is preferable to Medicare for all because private insurance is actually competitive and pays enough for hospitals to make enough money to keep their doors open (consider that most hospitals in the US are losing money so this is a real risk).

367,"This is a relatively new view I’ve developed based on my understanding of U.S. history. It’s not a reaction to Trump, but rather the evolution of the presidency and it’s role in government. The role of the president hasn’t changed much since its conception in 1789. Its military, diplomatic, appointment, and legislative powers have remained virtually unchanged in function. But the strength of those powers has dramatically increased over the years. To wit: George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson all made the position more influential in the early 1800s by way of their personal beliefs and prior experience, but that was to be expected and they didn’t do anything outside the original scope of what the Constitution laid out. Washington in particular was pretty adamant in limited approaches to executive action. Many presidents afterward ranged on how extensively they used their authority. Andrew Jackson vetoed dozens of bills and rewarded loyalists with appointments. Van Buren accomplishes little of note and focused on managing the economic downturn. Buchanan used his position to influence the Dred Scott case. And so on. Then, when the Civil War broke out, Abraham Lincoln suspended Habeas Corpus, the right to an appearance in court. He ignored Congress on military expansion and began increasing the Executive Branch’s authority on matters of legislation. You could say it was justifiable because of the war, but whether it was or not didn’t matter. A precedent had been set. Presidential authority never really stopped expanding after that. Theodore Roosevelt developed international power, Wilson created bills for consideration and tried to take an even more active role in world affairs. FDR’s New Deal programs vastly expanded the bureaucracy, and World War 2 necessitate near total control of American’s economy by the Executive Branch for military purposes. By the time the war ended, and America was an established superpower, the president had become more powerful then the Anti-Federalists had feared he could be in the 1700s. Admiringly, executive orders have been passed with decreasing frequency. George W. Bush passed 290, Obama 276, Trump 138, though his term isn’t over yet.

A child still exists regardless of whether the father opts in or out, creating a clear difference between abortion and LPS. For that reason, abortion is not murder, and LPS is not abandonment. That doesn't actually mean either or those things. Why do you assume that the woman chooses to continue with the pregnancy? I don't. In the event of an abortion there's no child to care for in the future. If she doesn't abort and carries the pregnancy to term, there is. That's the reality of abortion, and it's where LPS categorically differs from it. It's her choice to do so, or not... and her responsibility to deal with the consequences. Correct, it is her choice to do so, but her choice is based primarily on the fact that the fetus isn't considered a rights bearing individual worthy of moral consideration until such a time as it's born.

With the primaries coming up, the purpose of this post is to see if I can engage in an honest, no bullshit conversation with anyone can objectively convert me to the Sanders camp (or to any other Democrat for that matter). I am also not interested in debating about voting for a Republican I've concluded that my views would prevent me from voting from almost any of the 17 Republican candidates over Hillary. My view is that Hillary Clinton is the best Democratic presidential candidate available in the party today, and that all Democrats should vote for her in the primaries. Here are my main reasons for this view: 1) She is immensely qualified to be president. In fact I believe she is the most qualified candidate the Democrats have had in a long time. Four years as Secretary of State, eight as a US Senator, eight as First Lady of the US, and eight as the First Lady of Arkansas. 2) She is the most electable Democrat. Electability is extremely important and is the reason why I am most concerned about Bernie.

They don’t have a great location, they don’t have many efficiencies up the supply chain but they want to provide some good music and culture in the community while earning a living. They do paint-ins, live music, workshops, all that good stuff. So what they do is hire high school kids for about 4,000 hours a year on $11/hour. The kids have no rent and no bills aside from maybe gas and insurance. They gain experience while earning income in a cool work environment. Kids are happy, record store owner is happy, community is happy. With a $15 minimum wage, now the staffing costs go from 44k per year to 60k per year. The numbers no longer work and they have to close their doors. My proposal is to have minimum wage based on tax brackets.

452,"Moral failings or sins can be boiled down to malice and hypocrisy and alleged moral transgressions that do not fall into one of those categories are less serious. By sin I am not assuming that there is a higher power that will judge you (although I have postulated that it another CMV), I am just using it as a synonym for wrong thinking or behavior. I would say malice is much worse than hypocrisy. The Christian Seven Deadly Sins are not even great moral failings, they are, for the most part, relatively minor character flaws that any decent person might fall victim to, and in some cases not even failures. Gluttony, fornication, greed, sorrow, wrath, sloth, vainglory, hubris. Wrath is the only one of these that involves a real moral wrong and even that is arguable. The others are some degree of shortcoming, not sins that ought to result in you being cast into the pits of hell. Practicing magic, making idols, homosexuality, these sort of things are not ""sins"" to me at all. Malice covers a wide range of thoughts and actions. It could be interpreted to cover both positive actions and thoughts (positive in the sense of conveying malice), and negative ones, like lacking sympathy (not conveying the opposite of malice), although arguably lacking sympathy could be a separate category. If someone kills an animal because they need to eat that is much less of a sin (if at all) than someone who kills an animal because they want to hurt it. Hypocrisy is the ultimate thought crime, meaning if oneself is the beneficiary of inconsistent standards and others are the victims of that. To claim to have a standard and to knowingly not live up to it is worse than all of the Seven Deadly Sins. Inconsistency is related to hypocrisy but anyone might fall victim to it without intent.",Is it still hypocrisy for him to say that people should be faithful to their spouses?,clarity

I think this is a dangerous idea in terms of keeping the artifacts safe. In the Middle East for example, we have seen ISIS on many occasions specifically seek out and set Roy museums, statues, etc., so if they can’t guarantee the safety of what they already have, why should we trust them to keep safe returned artifacts? Even if the artifacts’ safety isn’t a concern,I don’t think modern civilizations have an inherent right to the treasures of ancient civilizations. Obviously if the artifacts were stolen, that was wrong, but they weren’t stolen by or from anyone alive today.

But as a person who has chosen to have sex knowing pregnancy is a possibility, i feel you have waived your rights to bodily autonomy.

Did you even read your own argument? Yikes. The point you obviously missed being that emotional states are subjective, and you can't just something as ""rational"" without assuming it in the premises. The qualia of subjective experience don't factor into the argument. Each person has to ""do their best"", in essence, to try and complement their emotional qualia with factual information unrelated to emotional experience. That's all rationality can offer a person - it's the conscious attempt to resist mental bias, not a cure-all that will overcome it all at once. And yes, deciding on things based purely on emotions is a mental bias. Since subjective is opinion, (i like blue, you like red) that means your own view on life is such - which means it doesn't fall under the rational rubric to begin with.

As for the workplace, almost no one gets pay increases by working harder. They get it by negotiating. Either at a performance review or by moving on to a new job. The studies I've seen generally seem to indicate that women are less willing to speak up and be aggressive or take risks, which hampers their ability to get higher paying jobs.

Now, how does the fact that Trump's speeches are a kind of Rorschach test that are commonly interpreted in a wide range of ways connect to the question of incitement? I see the link in the following way. Trump chose to speak in this ambiguous way using a lot of language that is provocative, especially in isolation. He also knew (or should have known given how often his supporters have enacted violence in response to what he has said, including the 2016 campaign rally he was unsuccessfully sued over and the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh) that some of his supporters -- and especially the supporters in that specific crowd -- would interpret his language as supporting actual fighting and encouraging them to do violence. The FBI had warned of possible violence at the event. And many domestic terror experts have been warning about increased risk of political violence since September 2020, and several specifical said that Trump's rhetoric increases the risk. So, with that background, Trump littered his speech with ""fight"" words and continued heated rhetoric. The speeches that preceded Trump's (which had to have been coordinated on some level) also used inflammatory rhetoric.

719,"Well, transgender is an umbrella term that refers to any person who identifies as a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth. We aren't 100% sure what causes a person to be transgender, but we do know that most people who become transgender experience a phenomenon called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is the feeling that your body is the incorrect gender from your mental gender identity. Essentially, a person born with a male body will at some point begin experiencing this feeling of depression, anxiety, and frustration related to the feeling that they are actually supposed to be a woman, but were given a male body. People who experience gender dysphoria are then advised to transition. Transition can just be social (referring to themselves as a woman, changing their name, etc. ), hormonal (taking blockers for their current hormones and taking hormone supplements for their identified gender), and surgical (surgically changing your primary and secondary sexual characteristics from those of your assigned gender to those of your identified gender). Trans people choose to transition at different rates depending on their comfort, medical history, and financial situation. However, regardless of the speed of transition, the act of transitioning reduces and often eliminates the feelings of gender dysphoria. I do not actually know a ton about the brain chemistry thing. I haven't dug that deep into it, I am just aware that studies are being done on that subject. And yes, if a person has a male body, but identifies as a female, and is attempting to transition, they are a woman.",Is gender the same as sex?,clarity

But penalizing student's math scores for what is, essentially, an english deficiency means that a student who excels in math but has mediocre english skills (in this case due to ESL or AAVE spoken at home) is weird. Do you think it is underfunded on the basis of race, or do you think there are other factors? Race is the primary one. Black wealth in america is ridiculously lower than white wealth. Combine that with historical practices like redlining, and you get poor districts and rich districts that are basically racially segregated. Not by law, but by history. This doesn't mean that every white student attends a good school and every black student a bad one, but the effects are disproportionate. A perfect solution would be to understand every individual students K-12 education trajectory, and know the status and opportunities each student had. That's also generally economically infeasible. You have to discriminate some how, either you ignore those factors and have ""race blind"" admissions, which has the effect of discriminating against black students who didn't have equal opportunity, or you do take race, as one (of a number of, economic status is another proxy that should be used) proxy, for opportunity, in your admissions process. How can you base college acceptance on something that can’t be verified, especially with each individual student? Keep in mind that choosing not to account for these things is also a choice, we just consider it the ""default"" because it favors white people over black people, and favoring white people is the default in American society. Perhaps the solution should be more funding instead of having colleges accept students on the basis of race. Indeed it should, but as you note, that doesn't help the current people.

If 99% of the applicants are A people, I think it would be unfair on all parties to lower the requirements in order to get a certain amount of D people. Or a different case where the best overall candidate is an AD, but doesn't get the job because the other A candidates are AB and AC. That's because it's a sample size of 10.

This got me thinking about the actual value of art that simply exists for arts sake. By that I mean art that doesn't exist for any purpose other than ""being art"".

The challenge to this part is usually quantum physics, but I am not enough into quantum physics to have a greater understanding of this. My perception of quantum physics is that they're inherently random, or at least not deterministic. My usual counterpoint is that while quantum physics aren't deterministic, randomness won't give humans free will either. I believe that only a deity could give someone free will, or even that the concept of free will really makes no sense. Okay, so if the world is deterministic, that means that everything has a cause and an effect.

Dumbledore only realizes, I think, that the child will definitely die when he sees the scar on Harry’s head and realizes he’s probably a horcrux. The child and Voldemort must face each other and the child lives and Voldemort dies, or Voldemort lives and the child dies. But, and it seems you would agree, before Dumbledore saw the scar, Dumbledore would have had no way of knowing that the child would definitely live or definitely die, even if he did have 100% faith in the prophecy. Right, exactly. While I agree this means he knew the child would have to die, the very same attack reveals that Voldemort can't kill the child. True. However, all that would mean (and remember, Dumbledore is very smart) is that at that time Voldemort couldn’t kill the child. He had no reason to believe that protection was immovable or unbreakable and would remain for Harry’s entire life. He knew what the protection was pretty much immediately too- he later explains it to Harry and not in a way that says he just figured it out. He would likely have assumed that the protection was enough to have saved him and might save him again in the future but that was no reason to believe that in the future, something might or might not happen to break that protection, thus rendering Harry vulnerable. And he was right (if he thought this), wasn’t he? Essentially, both scenarios that the prophecy offers are now impossible, resulting in the prophecy making even less sense than it did before. Nope. They are only impossible at that moment in time. There was no saying that in the future they would remain impossible. If Dumbledore was familiar with the protection that Harry got from his Mother, he would likely have been familiar with the fact that it can be broken too. It would be impossible for the prophecy to be fulfilled before that protection was broken, but that wasn’t to say it was impossible for it to be fulfilled, period. but I think this reasoning is flawed because if you look at the information Dumbledore had available to him, everything was telling him the prophecy was impossible.",Does Dumbledore assume Snape would never tell Voldemort?,assumptions

He fanned the flames before and after the election leading up to the 6th and prior to his suspension, there was no indication he was repentant. At the beginning of 2020, his calls to liberate various states lead to their capitals getting stormed in some cases, and a plot kidnap the governor of Michigan (which he never apologized for). There are still plenty of extremists of all stripes with ideologies that are vile/anti-gov/anti-Twitter/violent that are still posting on Twitter in the wake of the ban, but that's because they didn't incite real life violence, not because Twitter is rife with partisan censorship. The US doesn't have free speech absolutism to begin with, no matter how you slice it. We have laws against incitement because we've agreed as a society that incitement is wrong, so I think calling this ""a violation of his free speech"" or something like that is a bad faith argument. Another argument I've seen is that this sets the precedent for more bans and censorship that people without power won't be able to contest, and that this is a slippery slope.

[21][22] In June 2013 the national parliament (the State Duma) unanimously adopted, and President Vladimir Putin signed,[59] a nationwide law banning distribution of materials promoting LGBT relationships among minors.

There are, of course, situations where the line between adaptation and appropriation is unclear.

Maybe I'm misinformed but most of the ""rights"" Trans people are fighting for seem to be more about forced inclusion. Some of the the ""rights"" I hear about Trans people fighting for are housing, bathrooms, employment, and adoption. Cases where a Trans person may be denied things like housing should be up to the discretion of the landlord. It's fair for a land lord to deny a Trans person just for being Trans or any other reason because the land lord has the right to choose who they do business with. Morally speaking, its a bit scummy for sure, but why would a Trans person even fight to live there if the landlord is like that? Taking away the landlords ability to deny someone for whatever reason they want is unfair. To me it sounds like the government is legally requiring the landlord to accept this person just because they're Trans. Building separate Trans bathrooms are forcing businesses to spend money to accommodate a tiny portion of the population just so they can be comfortable. As far as employment goes, again, it should be up to the employers discretion to hire or not hire anyone as they see fit. If a Trans person is fully qualified for the job, employers shouldn't be forced to hire them just because they're Trans.

We’re already seeing displacement of workers for cheaper labor, in both automation and employing workers abroad. Increasing minimum wage will only accelerate this and increase unemployment. Small businesses are also negatively affected by minimum wage. As a country (I’m in the USA), we should want to increase entrepreneurship, especially at this scale, and minimum wage will only stifle existing small businesses and discourage people from creating new ones. A national minimum wage is also difficult to determine, as different cities, states, provinces, will have almost entirely different costa of living. Take the US for example, raising the minimum wage to $15/hr would do nothing for people in NYC, where the cost of living is high and the city’s minimum wage is already $15/hr. Going back to my first point of not subsidizing people’s living, I understand the point that this is necessary because in the current society we live in, most people need to work in order to sustain themselves.

A couple caveats: - My CMV mostly applies to followers of religions that attempt answer the unknown with their own beliefs and with focus to a ""God"". Some religions are more reality based than others. I'm not here to debate where religions rank in objective recognition of reality. For the purpose of this CMV, you can assume I'm referring to major western religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) - A spiritual person wouldn't be automatically excluded. It is possible to believe in the possibility of a higher power and still have an objective perspective on reality, science and reason. Belief in one of the religions named above requires willingness to ignore objective truths in favor of biased information. I think the most likely argument would be that including a wide variety of people with a wide variety of perspectives would only help design a 'perfect society'. Along those same lines, perhaps a person that happens to be a practicing Christian has expertise and ideas unrelated to their religious beliefs that could help the design. My response to both of these is there are enough humans that including some religious people isn't necessary. If we were a society of 500 people then I would understand that perspective.

There have been documented cases where a dog was hurt, and had fear, and trust issues with men. It's just like beating a dog. Consent also implies an ability to understand the situation the being is in. It's just like a child. They truly don't understand it. If dogs that are continually raped they can show signs of trauma, like aggression, paranoia, insecurity, depression, and nightmares, in the same way they would if they were abused in other ways.

I'm talking about cases such as James Gunn getting fired over tweets he made a long time ago (2009-2010), and Doja Cat getting criticized for using the word ""faggot"" in tweets from a few years back too. Here's why I hold this view: 1) People change. I think we can all say that the person you are today is not the person you were 10 years ago. Your beliefs and values change as time goes by, shaped by your varying life experiences. 10 years is a long time, in which many things can happen that drastically change your view on things. This is especially true throughout adolescence, when your thinking matures and your life is rapidly changing. Personally, many of my views were black and white years ago, but as I've gone through more experiences, my views have changed into something more grey. I think it would be really unreasonable if you treated me as if the only views I hold today were the views I held 10 years ago, many of which I would find abhorrent today. 2) People's lives don't revolve around social media. Building on the first point, people's views could change without them having to edit their social media history to reflect that. If my opinion on a subject matter changes, I'm probably not going to dig through my entire post history to delete every post that goes against my newly formed opinion.

Not many things out there are as deadly as gun Um, how about a 5'9"" man with bare hands? He doesn't need a gun in order to pose a deadly threat to an unarmed homeowner half his size.

1031,"Part of the immigration debate has been what the appropriate number of immigrants, especially low skill or education. The current levels are much lower than demand both from employers and potential immigrants providing incentives for both groups. Undocumented immigrants take jobs at lower than market wages and employers get a cheap source of labor. Ultimately I think this damages the least educated or skilled Americans and destroys incentives to innovate past the labor shortage. I’ll try and list some common arguments. 1. Undocumented immigrants are taking jobs Americans don’t want: I think the retort that Americans don’t want them at those wages and in those conditions succinctly summarizes my view here. 2. Labor shortages requires that competitive businesses raise wages and compensation. Additionally, the quit threat empowers workers to demand concessions from employers such as higher wages, increased hours, increased benefits. 3. Cheap labor empowers employers through the firing threat in low skill jobs. 4. A common criticism is that businesses will have to raise prices. This harm will be offset by the increased prosperity of the lower class such that they will be able to afford more goods and services or at least an equivalent level. 5. Some employers will go out of business: Businesses shouldn’t exist if they cannot pay their employees. Alternatively, they will be incentivized to find ways to increase productivity of their current workers through innovation or automation. When discussing these issues I can’t get past that we are barely taking care of our citizens especially minority communities. I’m also not against legal immigration. There is no reason to hide their employment and we can track their pay and make sure they don’t endure labor abuses. Undocumented immigrants lack recourse to government and may accept unsafe conditions. Legal workers have a hard time competing especially if they cost more and require OSHA compliance. Essentially the crux of the issue is whether lower prices justify lower wages.",What makes you think that lower average wages would reduce innovation overall?,reasons_evidence

Of course male strength gives a physical advantage but that almost besides the point. I don’t have data on the US specifically but murder of women accounts for a significant amount of overall homicide rates and this only goes up in more traditional/patriarchal based societies. Russia and India for example both have alarming rates of both female homicides. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that the US has areas where very traditional values are emphasised. Absolutely guns should be secured properly, but in many instances they just aren’t and there is frequently no law that requires they be so. I’m from the UK. My father owned guns when I was a child. UK law allows the licensed ownership of certain weapons(non automatic rifles/double barrelled shotguns) if the individual can pass a background check. The law required him to have the weapons and ammo locked up in separate locations and police would visit to ensure this was done appropriately every few years. I just don’t get the impression that US laws are anywhere near well regulated enough but admittedly that’s more of a point of view and I know it varies state to state. I wasn’t trying to focus on good guy/bad guy stories. I’m inclined to believe both are very rare. My concern lies with suicides or accidental discharges or anything that likely won’t fill the evening news for whatever reason. The sheer scale of US gun homicides means this must be a likely occurrence. Suicide attempts with guns are far more likely to succeed than almost any other popular method. I’d agree that news stories could be used by both sides of the argument to justify their case. The lack of ‘good guy’ stories is likely because such scenarios would be highly situational and the nature of firearms is that they are offensive rather than defensive weapons. The addition of guns to altercation is an escalation rather than the opposite. Happy to hear you managed to protect yourself with one but it’s only relevant to that situation and others just like it.

It seems as though more and more youtube channels will knowingly false copyright claim YouTube videos to not only get more views themselves but stunt the growth of the original content creator. There are no repercussions for these false copyright claims which is why so many YouTube channels do it to others, and in the end actual content creators get screwed. There's so much incentive for some channels to flat out lie. 2. Demonetization. Basically YouTube is now becoming more ""ad-friendly"" and demonetizing any content creator whose material is not deemed 'appropriate'. This leads to a massive wave of censorship on a platform that is supposed to encourage free speech (apparently not). Now content creators have to now follow ambiguous guidelines in order to be paid. It now gives YouTube and advertisers ambiguous power to deem content inappropriate, not pay the content creator, and still get their advertisements on YouTube.

On the eastern front, the Soviets never achieved a casualty ratio better than 2:1. From 41-43, they only had one quarter, 1943Q1, where it dipped beneath 4:1. Even in times when Germany was facing shortages and being pushed back they still achieved strong ratios. Armored warfare had a similar effect with a 3.5:1 ratio throughout the war. This lead to years like 1943 where the SU had a loss/production ratio of .98. Aircraft had a similar ratio. This indicates they had not learned to adopt modern tactics and relied on sheer numbers to win, something they could not repeat in another major war.

Typical libertarian UBI though. Still, this is taking a hit for you, $100 a month at max (if you spend everything every month). Let's see if you consider any of the other benefits worth $100 a month... Yeah that's a lot. Every company would pass as much of that VAT onto the customer as possible and that's a lot. And it will hit just about everything I need to buy. Yet my income hasn't gone up to help me afford it. And I'm also positive my landlord would increase rent because that's what city landlords do when they think there's more money out there. Also, I'm on SNAP, which Yang has indicated would be eliminated with UBI, so that's almost $200 more eating out of my SSDI check each month. So far, this deal is looking pretty terrible and life-altering for me. Not to mention the psychological toll of seeing lots of other people getting more money in a so-called ""universal"" plan and I get nothing but increased costs, just because I'm too poor and sick to make money. Or perhaps you will never be able to work, so this doesn't effect you, even so... Yeah let's forget all the work stuff. No benefit there for me and many other disabled people, not to mention the elderly disabled. Speaking of the elderly, haven't seen any clarification on if UBI would also have to be exchanged for Social Security Retirement benefits.

The environmental damage they do is just on another level and they absolutely pose a safety issue as they'll attack just about anything. People absolutely hunt them for sport, but they also acknowledge that they are nuisance/pest animals and that if they aren't thinned there will be devestating consequences. Wild pigs reproduce at a very high rate and they can wipe out large areas that would otherwise sustain the other wildlife. The sentiment among regular pig hunters is that if you're able to take a few pigs in an afternoon, they'll be back in a day or two. They are very, very difficult to remove from an infested area. The pigs can also get into residential areas and kill pets. There have been cases were even large family dogs have been killed, and that is doubly true in the field with trained hunting dogs. I know from experience that they have also gored human beings and left terrible wounds. It should be noted that hunters make a point of donating a tremendous amount of food to homeless shelters and soup kitchens. That is very much the case with deer and hogs. People aren't just killing these animals and leaving them, they are going to use - sport hunters or not. Some poorer families are even reliant on hunting in order to keep their family in food. That is still very much an economic and cultural reality in some areas. Only a psychopath would kill an animal and leave it, with the exception of an animal being heavily diseased, in which they are usually buried to hinder other animals in getting to it. Good hunters always make good use of their kills and they strive to limit the suffering of their prey by taking good shots. That's why keeping the traditions of marksmanship and hunter's education alive is so important. And for the record, hunting IS the most traditional way to collect meat.

I think the rational and responsible decision would be NOT having children, because the estimated satisfaction or happiness of their lives is very negative. You wouldn’t want your children to suffer. 2.) Having children when they are going to struggle for the rest of their life is just wrong. Let’s say you live in Africa, and you really struggle. You have almost no water, no food, and you have to work very-very hard just to get by. Using the 1.) argument, if your life is TRULY bad, you shouldn’t have children, otherwise you are just evil: you contribute to a new life being born in those horrible conditions. Therefore, if the situation is truly bad, they are (the parents) the main reason of it, because if they stopped having children, in ~50 years there would be actually no person there to suffer. 3.) So, if they are having children and the circumstances arent bad, we dont need to help them. If the circumstances are bad then they are irresponsible so it's their own fault, and they dont deserve any help.

Planes move so fast you need control hubs like ATC, but cars don't, making managing cars easier. I'm not sure, what you mean by this. Localized meaning that my car only needs to know about the ones near it. There is no benefit to my car having a connection to a car 1 mile behind me going in the opposite direction. The main thing is that the air traffic control systems already exist for planes, while they should be built from scratch for cars if the car traffic wanted to be synchronised the same way. You think that the entire ATC existing system could just be plopped down on roads and function the same way without being rebuilt? (which is useful in flying, but has little value in driving). I don't understand why you keep making statements like this, that seem totally ignorant to the way autonomous cars operate. They are constantly monitoring many data sources, the same as a human should (but often doesn't). Do you really think that monitoring multiple data points has little value when operating a car? How about this. I'll list some data points/sources, and you tell me which ones you think an autonomous car shouldn't be monitoring: vehicle speed, steering position, forward long range radar, forward short range radar, rear ultrasonic, rear side radar, forward camera, rear camera, passenger seat belt sensors, passenger weight sensors, GPS location, reported traffic conditions, wheel speed sensors, tire pressure, oil pressure, oil level, coolant temperature, coolant level.

Maybe because it's been years since I was a believer, but that's the kind of double thinking that puts me off religion in the first place: to simultaneously expect eternal happiness and still be sad about the journey there just seems like a fundamental disconnect between two beliefs, like knowing your foot will stop hurting soon and falling into a deep depression over it in the meantime.

A human is technically a human from the moment of conception. I don't care about a human collection of cells at that stage any more than I do a baboon's, or for that matter the bacteria which grow on us. If that fetus is a seperate living human then a womans right to do what she wants with her body doesnt override that lifes right to not be killed. I'm saying it necessarily warrants removal. The mother has a right to complete choice in terms of what she wants in and of her body. We dont solve our problems outside the womb by terminating lives. when one impedes on our bodily autonomy and we both wish to and have the capacity to remove them we do so in the least restrictive manner that does not further impede on our bodily autonomy or capacity to maintain it. Is this a reason for a different style of removal? Maybe, but because I can't see a procedure which doesn't necessarily do impede on her autonomy further and in a significant way, I'm inclined to support allowing the mother to choose the method of removal which works for her and which a physician is inclined to support. Why solve problems inside the womb by terminating a life? Because the person on which the fetus/baby is dependent on chooses to. The ultimate moral question is if that fetus is a seperate human life, and if human life has any value worth protecting. Not typically. For many people the line is whether it is meaningfully a person. This includes attributes such as rationality, feeling etc. Even by committing suicide and terminating yourself you can be criminally charged. No, at least here you can't. Physician assisted suicide is an entirely different conversation when it comes to the medical termination of life, as that patient is deciding their own fate, not the fate of the body they carry.

A mutual friend of mine was at a party (definitely a mutual friend, partying during covid is not very epic) and was making out with a man for most of the night. However, the next morning, she found out that this man was actually a woman. Now, here's the crux of the situation: If this were just a FtoM individual, I and my friend both firmly believe that there would be no issue because they're literally just a man. No deception involved there. However, my mutual friend's impression was that this woman was dressing as a man and having her friends that were there (all f\\k boys lol) use he/him pronouns to deceive women into hooking up with her because where I'm from, there are not a lot of LGBTQ+ folks. Her friends and her tik tok also said that she wasn't trans, and for the sake of this hypothetical, let's rule out the possibility that she is just beginning her transition, because again, if that were true, completely different situation. I believe that dressing as a man for deception is wrong. But the gray area is whether she was truly doing it to deceive women, or just to dress how she wants to dress, which there is obviously no problem there. So do you think she should have prefaced the interaction with my mutual friend with ""hey, I'm a woman by the way"", or is that not necessary?

1391,"Its important to first recognize that societies draw from their histories in order to establish precedents for the present. The construct for the Muslim world is markedly different than ours in the West. To us, an abandonment/separation of church and state was the first major move that allowed the West to begin its period of global dominance. This era can be defined as ~1750 to modern day. Times before that, marked by Christian Kingdoms and the Catholic Church's heavy influence are commonly referred to as ""the Dark Ages"". Muslims, however, have a very different history. From ~900 to ~1700 they were the unmatched world powers. Much sourced history from Europe in that time period reflects our fear of the constant threat of Islam taking more and more of Europe. (Ironically, the tables are now switched, and Muslims fear Western influence in their countries more and more) Throughout the period of their dominance, the many different Caliphates and empires were marked by their strong carrying of religion and state hand in hand. In many societies, 13th century Baghdad for example, the only societal position level with that of the Sultan were the religious leaders. It should also be noted that these empires allowed science and discovery to work hand in hand with religion. This is proved by countless innovators (Avicenna, Averroes, ibn Battuta, ibn Khaldun, etc) who were well-trained in religious disciplines in addition to their other pursuits.

Whereas men face greater danger in times of war and disaster, as well as in peacetime by doing the majority of dangerous jobs involving manual labour. So there's also a class divide, and a racial one (black men face much more physical danger than black women). But men also have more places where they can be reasonably safe (e.g. walking down the street, spending time with family, hanging out with friends at a bar, sitting next to a stranger at a cinema), but which have all been places women have been molested or assaulted at.

1430,"A friend of mines studying economics tells me how effective pigovian taxes are, those being taxes placed directly on goods and activities we want to discourage, but not necessarily ban. In his opinion, the levy on sugary soda drinks here in the UK was a success. I argue that we can go further, we should consider directly taxing people for being overweight or obese. From an economic and moral POV: obesity is already an economic drain, people of working age lose days off work, die prematurely or develop health issues that stop them from leading a productive life. For countries that provide or subsidies healthcare, obesity is already a massive drain on their coffers, people ought to exercise much more personal responsibility. A tax can help motivate people to changing their lifestyle. I get that the logistics might be hard to accomplish, but I understand Japan already has something similar, and the majority of working people are subjected to it. The funds raised by this tax can go towards making biking, gyms, and healthier food more affordable, as well as paying to cover this tax in the first place. Not only people will be healthier, better looking, take personal care more seriously, and potentially help the economy - there are also environmental benefits too! More reasonable meat consumption, and less using cars and more walking too. I can already sense some of the objections: I'm far from libertarian, I don't see this as government overreach. People with conditions that genuinely make it hard to lose weight, like Prader Willy, should obviously be exempt. If being overweight is an important part of your career (like James Corden), you probably could be exempt too, I guess.

Why should they be kept in poverty because of my cultural concerns about child labor. There is nothing immoral about a child working - if you close the factory the same child will have to work just hard for just as long on a farm. The stability and pay of factory work might allow this working child's children to go to school instead of toiling away on the farm. The difference is, by eating an animal, I'm choosing the suffering of ten times as many plants, plus the suffering of an animal. and I'll admit it: I have no absolutely no idea what you mean by this. Would you mind explaining this? No you are not. The animal would have eaten the plants regardless of your decision. By eating the animal you are not participating in the death or the potential suffering of the plants. Animals are more efficient.

In my view, this is a bad idea. First, I will agree that there is a student loan debt problem in the US. I have friends who graduated with upwards of $50,000 of debt (and I know this number can extend into the hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt in some cases). This can be a huge burden as graduates struggle to pay off this debt. However... Cancelling student debt is unfair. This relates to the father in Iowa's argument as it is unfair to all those diligent people who actually paid off their student debt. It's also unfair to the taxpayers and those people who may have not went to school because of their financial situation. For example, lower income families who could not afford post secondary education and did not take out a loan to attend college and will not benefit at all. Forgiving student loan debt promotes poor decision making and is a moral hazard. For starters it does nothing to educate young people of the consequences of loans and even decision making. Furthermore, it will benefit most those with degrees that are not in demand. For example, a student taking out a loan for medical school or an engineering degree will most likely be able to pay that loan back.

It is rule by a specific group of people. Some oligarchies have been powerful families, wealthy people, or even a church. The oligarchy I will be focusing on will be a one-party system where the oligarchs choose their own members as they see fit and vote on decisions. There are multiple reasons why an oligarchy is an ideal form of government: - Democracy is heavily flawed. One of the most common forms of government in the developed world is Democracy, or at least Republics which are technically Representative Democracy. There are also Constitutional Monarchies which have democratic elements. The majority of people are highly uninformed on politics and can be easily swayed by false lies and promises. The majority cannot be trusted to vote for the most reasonable choice. - There is more incentive towards effectiveness.

1537,"While SCOTUS considers same-sex marriage, in the meantime, I figured it would be relevant to post this related view. Simply put, I do not believe the Bible should be considered as a source that condemns homosexuality in the modern day. First, although Leviticus straight up says ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman it is an abomination"" we can discount it (and the Old Testament at large) as a guide for dictating behavior in the modern day, since it also allows for slavery, dictates sacrificial rituals, and describes other obsolete laws that hold no weight as prescriptions for behavior today. Second, regarding the New Testament, in the Epistle to the Romans, yes Paul discusses homosexuality. But, I believe that Paul is not condemning modern homosexuality but rather the homosexual behavior that manifested in his time, which was largely nonconsensual or coercive, like pederasty. This is underscored by the main message to the Romans being one of love. Explicitly: Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. Nonconsensual pederasty as practiced in ancient times would be a crime and the opposite of love as it does harm to others and therefore is justifiably condemned and consistent with Paul's message.

And its crash was bloodless only because nobody wanted to protect it. After 1991, Russia was really into trying to become part of the world. The first years of Putin in power was the years of trying to start cooperation with NATO firstly and then to be part of a big Europe “from Lisbon to Vladivostok”. All these initiatives did not meet with the understanding of Western countries. That period finished with the Putin’s Munich speech on 10 February 2007. After that, Russia started to look for other ways of integration. Trying to develop Eurasian Customs Union, Eurasian Economic Union. Mostly because of economic reasons. Since the global market was already apportioned. The key point of the existent of Eurasian Economic Union was the participation of Ukraine in the project. As soon as the agreement was signed, the Maidan started in the Ukraine and it led to the change of power in the country. Of course, it had the internal reasons, people were unhappy with the corrupt and uneducated government. Apart from that, the coup was widely welcomed by the West.

While I haven't looked extensively into scientific reporting on the subject, I think there very clearly can be a link between the two when thinking about it with common sense: If you tell an impressionable child or teenager that they should always be happy with their body regardless of what people say, this will lead to them believing they should not focus on their physical health as much as they should. This is a dangerous mindset, as normalizing obesity for the sake of positive mental health can lead to a drastic degradation in one's physical health. Noted here: ""[Obesity] is related to ≈1–400 000 deaths per year and costs society an estimated $117 billion in direct and indirect costs.""

Now I'm older and Sony and Microsoft's controllers are fine and Nintendo's are too small. The simple fact is that Nintendo is targeting a younger age demographic that has smaller hands. They made the Pro Controller to target older players. A little kid doesn't have spending money to drop on a fancy controller, so it makes sense to make the default controller fit their hands. Older gamers tend to have jobs and money, so they can afford to pick up an extra controller. If you look at the pricing, it fits this logic. A Nintendo Switch Pro Controller costs $60 (the same price as a game). A Microsoft Xbox Elite Series 2 controller goes for $180. Nintendo knows their default controller is better for kids, so they also need a controller for adults. It needs to be relatively affordable because it's going after a large chunk of the market. Microsoft's normal controller is already targeted at adults, so they are just trying to go after the hardcore adult gamer crowd. This is a niche group, so it makes sense to use more premium materials and charge more for it. As a final point, it's not just children. Nintendo is also trying to go after women, the elderly, and other groups that are outside the core young male demographic that most gaming companies focus on. These groups tend to have smaller hands, and enjoy simpler gesture based controls. This formula is what made the Wii so successful. Ultimately, Nintendo knows exactly what they are doing.

1690,"I think your OP is missing an important part of representation. People are asking for representation because it is a good thing to do, not because it's easier. If you are making a film with a trans character, I hope that the character is written with the intention of a positive representation of trans people. That doesn't mean the character has to be a good person or the hero of the story, but that they won't fall into negative or hateful stereotypes. For example: the character could be a murderous taxi driver or a best friend who loves to fart, but probably shouldn't be a trans man who peeps at kid's dicks in the urinals or a goofy trans woman who keeps surprising her dates with her massive cock. If you are creating a story with trans characters AND you are doing it with love for that character and trans people, then I think representation should be important to you. It is easier to cast CIS people for trans roles. There are a lot more CIS people. But if you care about the group you are trying to represent, then why wouldn't you take the extra effort to cast an actual trans actor. One of your main reasons is that you don't believe there are enough experienced trans actors out there. I just don't think that is true. If there's a casting call for a paid part, tons of trans people will come out for that role. There aren't that many roles out there for trans people. You can find someone who can accurately portray your character. Plus there are tons of trans actors who aren't unknowns and have been in things. You can just cast them. It's not like they are constantly busy. If I was going to play a trans character, I would have to do a bunch of research on what it's like to be trans, I would learn to talk, walk, and act differently, and I would just need a bunch of work to get in the right headspace.

Self-esteem is usually highly tied to one's own perception of their social importance. Thus, on this basis tattoos increase self-esteem in some manner because social importance should be synonymous with the type of social reward they are trying to get from people.

Furthermore, older voters have an incentive to ""YOLO"" as they won't necessarily live to see the consequences of their actions. Currently, the population pyramid in a growing number of democracies is skewed upward (among Americans aged 18+, the median age is in the mid-40s) and the historical balance between young voters who are open to new ideas and older voters who are more experienced (but also more nostalgic and less self-interested) is shifting in favor of older voters, who are more inclined to support politicians like Trump and European far-right populists, many of whom do not have the long time horizon associated with younger voters.

For these extremely grand amounts of money, there is no reason we couldn't simply subsidize basic living requirements. We're talking tens of billions of dollars a month. You redirect that and other forms of welfare into subsidizing free shelter, food, water, climate control, and medicare for all and I see very little wrong with that system aside from it needing to be constantly monitored for corruption and business favoritism like every government program does. UBI does not have that benefit, no it suffers from all the problems welfare systems do, but scaled up to everyone now.

The negative effects of spanking outweigh the benefits because: Spanking can create an environment of fear and resentment, which is negative for a child’s development. Part of growing up involves making mistakes and learning how society expects you to behave. Children are not born with a moral compass ingrained into their brains, so it is natural to break rules at some point. It is up to the parent to figure out how to enforce these rules without harming the child and instilling fear. Here’s an example: you are a parent, and your child accidentally breaks your neighbor’s window with a baseball and doesn’t tell anyone. If your response is to spank them, the child will feel that they are bad, which will encourage them to hide any more mistakes they make from you. They will fear getting caught again, and will resent you for spanking them.

This isn't always entirely sexual, but if a woman is wearing a low cut shirt or a revealing outfit, I'll catch myself glancing over before I remind myself not to ogle. I think most straight males would have a difficult time not looking at, or not having one or two sexual thoughts if they were in a room full of naked women.

In almost every subreddit that discusses politics or anything remotely political there are clear overarching views that most subscribers have.

1790,"I disagree. Internet access is a natural monopoly because 1) providing internet access requires a high barrier of entry (cost of infrastructure) and 2) is able to boot out even slightly slower competition. Do you understand that even if there are 2 competitors it's not a monopoly? So, even if it's not like anyone can start offering internet, it's enough that there are enough companies (at least two) who can offer it to break the monopoly. This does not apply to water as pretty much every house has just one water pipe that takes it to one water provider. Furthermore, with 4G and even more with 5G, you are not going to even need a cable to your house to have high speed internet. This will force the internet providers using the cable to your house to keep their prices low or otherwise people will switch to the mobile network. In the future, we might see even internet provided through satellites. What you're writing might apply to some rural areas. There it may be reasonable to either provide the internet by the state or force the private monopoly providers to cap their prices. However, the problem with this approach is that it will provide people with wrong incentives. Moving to a rural area gives many advantages over urban living, most importantly in terms of housing cost. This may attract people to move to rural areas. But then it is wrong that they can then demand others to pay the thing that has higher cost in the rural areas, namely the internet. It's quite unfair to city dwellers who pay themselves sick for the high housing cost to then having to subsidize the rural people's higher cost of internet. You might as well argue that why isn't housing similar necessity and the urban people should be subsidized by rural people for the higher housing cost. For example, in the US roads are publicly funded and highways across the nation are free to use and of exceptional quality.

1797,"I think free college for everyone is a mistake that will lead to lower wages for everyone as the supply of college graduates will not be tied to the demand for college graduates with those degrees. It will decrease the income of the middle class while doing nothing to help the poor, who cannot afford not to work while they get a degree. I also believe it will lead to a lowering of the quality of education as colleges focus on enrolling more students while lowering the cost-per-student to educate them in order to receive more funding, rather than on giving students a better education (assuming it's a per-matriculated student payments by government). I believe that easy access to government student loans is partially responsible for the decline of the middle class as it is responsible for deflating salaries for the middle class. Employers no longer have incentives to create scholarships as there is a huge supply of graduates. The supply of graduates combined with their high student debt leads to wages falling as people are competing with more educated people for the same jobs, but are desperate to get jobs because they have high loan payments on which they can't ever default, putting the bargaining power in the hands of the corporations. Essentially, we've created a generation of indentured servants. I believe that the best case scenario for restoring the middle class is to cancel federally subsidized loans, to reduce the supply of college graduates. This will force colleges to compete for fewer dollars and reduce tuition, it will force corporations to increase incentives to get certain degrees or create training/apprenticeship programs to ensure they have enough qualified employees, including scholarship programs.",How would reducing overall education benefit the economy?,implication_consequences

One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race.

Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization.

1891,"thought i'd give a shot at ""fresh topic friday"", and as far as i can tell, this extremely important issue has never been discussed on the sub. The reason that I believe Rocket League is better than Overwatch from a strictly competitive standpoint is found in its simplicity. Overwatch is a very complicated, busy, and nuanced game, which makes it a lot of fun to watch and play. However, since you have this huge roster of heroes (growing consistently) with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, balancing is a nightmare. In order for the roster to be balanced, there needs to be constant adjustment to potencies, abilities, and pretty much every aspect of every hero. Because there's just so much, the game will never be truly balanced, not to mention balance in the context of Overwatch is rather subjective anyways, since something that's totally unbalanced in the gold ranks might have no impact on gameplay in grandmaster play (pharmercy, for example). Because of these things, the game will never be truly balanced for all players or even any players, so its purity as a competitive game is compromised. One might be forced to switch from their main(s) due to the meta, giving competitive edge to other players, not because any player has more or less skill than another, but because the meta has shifted in or out of their favor. Not to mention that the objective-based playstyle of the game is asymmetrical, meaning that in tie-breaker situations, the winning team may very well be decided by the flip of a coin, since a team might be better at attack than defense or vice-versa. Rocket League, on the other hand, is almost flawless competitively. There is nearly no variation from game to game and there is no asymmetry in competitive play.",Is golf objectively better than football?,clarity

A representative democracy divides the people by ideology stances while a monarchy unites the people. Democracy also does not offer freesom of choice, instead it is but an illusion.

Think about it this way, if you were in a high-jumping competition and the bar was lowered for you but not everybody else you would feel insulted that less was expected from you. As well as insulting POC, AA also devalues their achievements. The fact it exists means that, no matter how hard they work, there will always be some people that will attribute their success to AA.

1899,"I’m convinced that the belief in the legitimacy of personal accountability for one’s own actions stemming from some alleged freedom in their pursuit openly clashes with the scientifically inevitable view of any phenomenon as causally predetermined. As far as my-rather narrow-understanding of science goes, scientific models, as sophisticated as they might get, eventually boil down to either theorising causal links between phenomena or making probabilistic inferences, which are nothing but a way to get around uncertainty about those same causal links. So science is inherently deterministic. This, following Kant’s footsteps, has to do with the boundaries of our rationality, which can’t possibly conceive reality outside of the realm of causality. Thus, there can’t possibly be any scientific model of human behaviour as a phenomenon which could assert the existence of transcendental, aka causeless, motives for our choices. Rather, any choice made by a human being must be traced back to exogenous factors causally shaping it, namely genetic heritage and environmental aspects. In light of this, free will and any moral category branching from it (guilt, blame, accountability, retributive justice) is scientifically baseless. This is hard to process for many of us, since the above categories are hardwired in our cultural and social paradigms, and most individual and social choice drivers are based upon them: our moral codes, criminal justice systems, some of our basic interpersonal dynamics (e.g. wrath towards perceived offenders, resentment for alleged injustices, etc). Many argue that, regardless of any scientific and philosophical consideration about it, belief in free will is an inalienable backbone of society, without which no orderly society could thrive, as it lays foundations and provides legitimacy to enforcing law, exercising moral judgement, both of which any social structure needs in order not to degenerate into chaos. Now, my argument takes a step further here, probably a controversial one. I think that it is possible to both scientifically rule out the possibility of free will and pragmatically acknowledge our need for personal accountability when it comes to organising society, and I think it is desirable to do so.",Could the assumption of free will be a vital element of society to allow for freedom of expression and self determination?,assumptions

Basically everything that revolves around the mental capacity This doesn't seem accurate, as brain damaged individuals or people who are comatose are still valued far more than animals or plants, what with the vast medical expenses some families will go through to maintain their loved ones' lives. Since these individuals are valued but have no mental capacity, this premise is at best an incomplete picture, or, at worst, it's simply not a true premise. I think that the fallacy lies here.

Even with the surgeries and artificial hormone replacements, wouldn't the artificial nature of these changes render the claim illegitimate? From a societal standpoint, obviously the idea of gender identity is one that has, for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other.

She never told him ""I don't want to have intercourse on the first date, but we can mess around and do other stuff if you want"". Instead, she beat around the bush and contradicted her own words with her actions. To be honest, I don't think this was sinister or even conscious on her part. I think she had gotten herself into a situation and didn't even really know herself what she wanted, she just knew what she didn't want when those things were about to happen. And in those cases, she did communicate that she didn't want it and when she communicated it, those things didn't happen. but you still made clear assertions about her motives and character that are not supported by her actions.

If she had communicated better what she actually wanted - whether that be to Aziz or in her retelling of the story in Babe - we wouldn't have to speculate.

Other religions such as Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc. do not go to foreign countries to convert people, prohibit birth control, or allow polygamy.

Now, you might try to dodge the question and say that all else isn't equal, and point to a bunch of other situations with racial disparities, but the issue is that a lot of those other situations have the same issue where, on their own, the race of the person suffering the disadvantage doesn't actually affect the negative effects they suffer. So please, before we move on to all those other circumstances, answer the question so we can have a firm premise moving forward. Let's not because we can't and the thought experiment serves no purpose but to continue to conflate economic and racial disparities. What's so unique about racial issues that makes them cause completely different negative effects compared to economic issues? If your hypothesis - that all poor people regardless of race are equally disadvantaged by the same systems - is true, then there would be no racial gaps at all. Yet there are. We can acknowledge that things like discrimination against minorities was commonplace in the past, and thus means they're starting out in a lower place in the present, however the issues keeping people poor is the same regardless of race. So lemme ask you something: is affirmative action meant to counteract what put minorities down in the first place (even though those benefitting from affirmative action were probably never direct victims of those things) or is it meant to counteract what's keeping people down?

Let's start with STEM, the current teaching methods for stem frontloads excessive explanation. I believe that it should start with application and be mostly application as well. Teachers should teach by doing relevant problems and explaining the reasoning behind each step of the solution process. In the case of liberal arts, it will be more complex. I think that there should be no structured required ""English"" class besides grammar. Instead, a school will have a board of English teachers. These teachers are to submit 6 creative papers (just a paper on anything, research, opinion, etc.) of substantial length, prior to the start of the school year for the students to view. Students will be required to submit 12 creative papers in total as they wish throughout the school year, teachers will help and critique the papers. Teachers will have to submit another 6 papers. All these papers will be anonymously posted in some sort of fashion to be judged by the student population. For students: there will be a grade based on student voting and one based on the teacher board. The grades do not count numerically, this is pass/fail.

2049,"Just the other week a polce officer, in his car, asked a man who was already outside of his car for his liscense. The dash cam shows him pat his pockets and then reach into his car for his wallet. The officer fired four shots at him with a gas station not several yards behind him. I understand what you are saying here, but 'sudden movements' can be whatever the officer wants it to be. That happened in my home town of Columbia, SC. The officer in question was fired and is facing charges. The first time I watched that video, I saw the guy make a sudden and jerky move towards his vehicle and thought, ""Shit, I'm siding with the officer on this one."" Then the asshole started shooting--I went so far as to download the video and mark out a timeline for when the shots were fired. Former SC Trooper Groubert fired his first shot before the victim had even completely turned around. There was no way he could have positively identified a weapon. He then proceeded to fire 3 more panic shots in a crowded place, long after it was apparent the victim did not have a weapon. The officer was in the wrong--not just wrong, but VERY fucking wrong. However, the state of South Carolina fired him and is taking appropriate measures against him. With that said, it does not change the fact that the victim gave the officer reason to be alarmed. Sudden movements where you don't inform the officer can result in bad things. Should the officer have shot? Absolutely not. But he absolutely did have cause to elevate his security posture. Not to be rude, but are you American? Police usually don't even ask to see registration unless they suspect the car of being stolen. They usually want to see proof of insurance. The 'liscense and registration' thing is only in movies for routine stops. Yes.

So when IOS rolls out an update that breaks the game even temporarily that's Apple costing Nintendo money, and public esteem. That is bad for business.

All international markets are secondary consumers to them. Japanese companies typically (and almost universally) seek to be profitable by just selling inside Japan.

2165,"In the contemporary stand up scene, especially for those comics who are political and socially progressive, it is commonly held belief among most comedians that 'good' comedy, or the comedic art which contains the most merit, is that which targets people topics and groups which are the most privileged and high in the power structure of society. Hence the phrase 'punching up'. For example, making fun of trumps hands as being abnormally small is not body shaming or offensive, for he enjoys privilege and advantage due to where he is situated in the hierarchy of groups and people in society. Conversely, jokes of a racial or sexual nature, whether cliche or brilliant comedic aritery, are ddeemd as punching down an problematic since the object of such jokes are groups who are marginalised and disenfranchised. This extends to subjects and topics as well, such as sexual assault, suicide, mental illness. Mt view is primarily this it is morally, ethically and artistically justifiable for a comedian to make fun people and subjects that would constitute punching down, as long he or she punches up and most importantly, punches at her or himself. That is to say, as long as one makes light of their own weaknesses, their own insecutires, their own biases and prejudices, they are effectively conveying that they are no better or worse than who they might be ridiculing as part of their routine, whether it be the black single mother in the crowd (punching down) or the white blue collar republican (punching up). The best examples of this are the NY Comics from 97 to 07, otherwise known as the comedy cellar crowd or OA crowd.

However, in most cases, following a “defend first, then attack” strategy is an effective way to win. - Most teams make plans to grab the other team’s flag to win, but in most cases the defenders have the advantage, as they can see the attackers coming and intercept them on a shorter route (assuming they are deployed well back from the halfway border). Also, it’s common to put your best players on offense, so putting good players on defense creates a net that can stop almost all attacks. - Unless one team has a clear advantage in coordination or speed, the game turns into a sort of stalemate, with indecisive raids until one side makes a big gamble. By being prepared for this and capturing the attackers, the tide of the game will turn. - Capture the flag is a numbers game—by capturing and holding the other team in jail (baring jailbreaks) it becomes much easier to capture the flag (the idea is to get the numbers advantage then attack). - As long as you play within the rules, any criticism that it is a “scumbag way to play” or “cowardly” is irrelevant.

And if the only internships you can find are unpaid, then the cold hard truth is you don't deserve to be paid. Reason 2: Companies need to invest in interns to gain some value back, and they can only afford to pay interns if they get more than what they invest in, In addition, it's also about a company's profitability. Very often, in order for the company to get some value of out their interns (Even low skill jobs like flipping burgers), they need to put in a lot of trainings - to no surprise, this incurs costs to the employers. And even after training, interns are very likely to mess up due to their inexperience (which is fine), and cleaning it up also incurs cost.

Either you were not listening, (extremely likely), or she was too impaired to properly communicate that and defend herself.

One thing that surprised me was how little I knew about the most popular Christian church before I started researching it closely. Here are my responses to your issues. Granted I can't speak for the church, but this is how I see things: Creationism and certain views that contradict plausible science that has been proven again and again. The Catholic church has no problem with the theory of evolution or any of the other commonly accepted scientific theories as far as I'm aware. We do not hold to any strict creationist view of the world, so there is no problem here at all. The fact that there is such a harsh distinction between the two possible afterlives: endless punishment or endless paradise, and the fact that someone evil like Ted Bundy, ""confessed"" and apologized for his sins before execution, would be sent to Heaven and a virtuous, amazing human being like Bill Gates would be sent to Hell because he is an atheist. I'm not an expert on this, but I believe the Catholic church does not actually believe in a strict heaven vs. hell. There is at least heaven, purgatory, the resurrection, and hell. Personally, I do not think most people who are non-Christian or unbaptized when they die go to hell, but I'm not sure what the official church statement on that is. Anti-gay, anti-contraception and other repressive movements in the name of religion. This is a bit of an issue admittedly in the church. However, in our defense I would say that the Catholic church permits more disagreement within it than most churches. Officially the church is against contraception, for example, but I think you can still be OK with contraception and be admitted to the church. No one asked me my view on that before accepting me in. The fact that there are so many religions, and within those, many different denominations and inconsistencies. How can one possible say their belief is the absolute truth, held above the others? Again, I like the Catholic church position here. The Catholic church accepts a significant amount of disagreement in the knowledge that we have yet to find absolute truth on most topics.

The characteristics that I think make a being’s life worth valuing are: self awareness, a conscious desire to live (as opposed to a instinctual desire), capacity for joy. When I say these are lives that we should value, I mean that they are lives that nobody has the right to end. For example I think there is no problem at all in swatting a mosquito, but I think it is very important that we protect the killing or the abuse of intelligent animals such as chimpanzees.

2277,"Now, before we start this, I'd like to clarify a few things, just for the sake of everyone's sanity. I am NOT trying to convert anyone to a religion. I am a Christian, but today I'm not arguing that as my main topic. I'm only arguing that it is illogical to believe that there is absolutely no God. So, technically, under this argument, agnosticism would be a valid belief system. Another clarifier I'd like to make is that arguments against God based on how the people who follow Him is not a good argument here, because it assumes then that the people would always be doing what He said, which I would like to say from my side is definitely not the case. And last, Pastafarianism is definitely not a religion. It was made as a satirical religion. Everything clear? Good, let's get started. My first point I'd like to make is the argument of the universe's existence. Because the Big Bang happened, we know that the universe has a starting point. Because of that starting point, we know that the universe has a beginning. So the question is, what created the universe? In order for the universe to exist, you would need a being with infinite power who existed outside of space to create it all. The second argument is the existence of time. Now, some may argue that time is infinite, and to a certain degree it kind of is, at least going forward. But if you look at Einstein's theory of relativity and his theories on how the universe was created, you'll see that time would necessarily have a beginning: the beginning of our universe. This would mean that, because time has a beginning, there would need to be something that came before it, something that wasn't restricted by it and therefore had no need for something to come before it. This, again, is where God comes in. Now, a common argument against God is that the universe could have happened on its own without causation. Now, this argument is rather baseless, and essentially turns the universe into an all-powerful being it can create something out of nothingness. But in order for it to do this, it would need to have existed beforehand, in order to be able to exist.",Why assume it has to be a being?,assumptions

I think that, although the universe has the capability of sustaining human life outside of earth, that intelligent life, as of now, is entirely on earth, and that the universe is for us to discover. I am going to present some views using religion and not using religion, since although religion can be important in this argument, I will still have points to counter those of non-religious people. With Religion It is stated that humans were created in the image and likeness of God. Other creatures cannot distinguish right from wrong with a conscience, we can, which is what makes us intelligent life. Since the events of the bible are focused on events that took place on earth, and the Christ took place on earth, how would other intelligent life find their salvation if they didn't have these events take place where they were? Through the crucifixion of Christ, it is taught that he reopened the gates of Heaven.

It has one of the longer damage durations in the game (in other words, it brings you to a complete stop and takes a long time to start up again), and at least in Mario Kart Wii is completely unavoidable unless you're going through an ""automatic"" part of the track (such as being shot through a cannon as a feature of the course). OK, so if you're good at the game, they're frustrating, since they're the only thing that can consistently slow you down once you're faster than everyone else. And that frustration is OK, since it's all in the spirit of competitive balance. But on the last lap, and specifically the last half-lap, a blue shell is not only frustrating, but game-breakingly unfair.

These models are perfectly sound, theories. However, given that they are derived under strict assumptions, they are unlikely to always map the real world accurately 100% of the time, because economic agents and plenty of other variables are fundamentally unpredictable.

The ESRB itself was created in the 90s in response to backlash over games being tOo vIoLeNt, like doom and mortal kombat because of mounting pressure to indepently regulate, preempting government regulation. This threat of government intervention is why I believe the ESRB is bad. It has undue power over artistic liberty because of the threat of government censorship. While government enforcement has been ruled out in the US, other countries are stuck with legally enshrined rating systems. ESRB ratings are literally just projecting entirely arbitrary moral standards onto art, and forcing it to display their opinions of it. While I respect their right to provide their opinions on games like any other reviewer, I believe it should not be forced onto games uninterested in the system, much like how metacritic and ign reviews aren't listed on the box.

2460,"I'm just going to jump in as the OP and I have spoken before on the topic. If anyone would like to join the thread, I can explicate my position. Basically, I'll be using mathematics as a similarly non-subjective philosophy to consider. In my experience, people hold morality to an unfair standard where we would all say it is unfair to say that math is subjective — despite mathematics requiring axioms to stand. I can't ""help"" but to agree with this. Whether that's because my brain is convinced (which I don't exactly control), or whether that's because reason is reasonable, because its the nature of reality, or because it is culturally ingrained, etc. Basically, I am not sure why I agree, but I am sure it is more or less one of those reasons. If you hold conflicting goals (or a self-conflicting framework for achieving them), any action you take is irrational. Here when you say ""you"" do you mean, any given individual (singular), or any given rational actors (plural)? I think this may be a major point of miscommunication. If I hold goal A and goal B, and within goal B is goal ¬A, any action I take in furtherance of either of my goals is self-defeating to the other. A rational actor cannot act rationally in this condition. Because you're considering a ""rational actor"" with an existential conflict, you're going to get conflicting moral frameworks. So to the extent that a rational actor is able to control which goals he or she holds, he or she must act to hold self-consistent sets of goals in order to actually able to act rationally. A rational actor must not hold conflicting goals – this is by definition. I agree with this and yet I can't conceive how it is irrational to have to choose between two conflicting (not mutually exclusive or contradictory, but conflicting) values.",Why would one have to be wrong?,reasons_evidence

The curriculum is mostly made up of books that average elementary students will find pleasurable. In high school, most of the curriculum is based off of classic books that, while making it easy to relate to course standards, many students find boring. Not only that, but many are from way long ago with old dialects, which are less relevant to a student than any text in a modern dialect would be. I'm not advocating for completely eradicating old classics, but currently I'd say they make up about 75% of the average English curriculum and should instead make up no more than 10%. Modern books can teach the pedagogy equally well or even better. With a modern book, students are interested. They will actually read the book rather than skimming it or simply reading the Sparknotes. They will want to participate in classroom discussions much more.

Calling western (especially us that’s the one I have the most experience with) culture a rape culture is meant to highlight our complicity in the frequency with which sexual assault happens. The fact that it’s a political movement or a political statement to say that rape and sexual assault is bad and that we should root out the causes and small ways that we allow or even encourage it to happen says something about how deeply embedded in the collective psyche it is (I’d also argue that it also says something about those who would politically stand against it). Your analogies are just absurd. Murder is very uncommon (without looking, I think 5 per 100k is on the highest end in the US) while some sources put the rate of sexual assault in colleges at 1 on 3 women.

A right is used so loosely it seems these days, but it really is a huge deal, something that shouldn't be taken for granted in any circumstance. One concern I see in implementing all of these purposed rights is the issue of whom is providing them. With the right to vote, you are able to vote and is essential to government directly. With the right to free speech, it takes really nothing on anybody's part because you just are allowed to do so.

2508,"Currently college students under the age of 24 are not eligible for rent assistance or food stamps. I think they should be for the following reasons: In the United States we don't offer/reduce benefits based on the reason someone is poor. Whether you're a drug addict, recently divorced, just plain make bad choices, etc., these programs do not ask why you're poor. Exact when someone is in college - the programs are making a judgement call that the reason you're poor is not good enough compared to others who are poor. People are in college to better themselves. By not allowing students to access these benefits that people their age not in college may receive, we are suggesting the government shouldn't/doesn't want to help people better themselves. So much data has been produced suggesting most benefits only allow people to tread water and not really improve their situation. Here is an opportunity to assist people in actually bettering their situation. Not everyone has wealthy parents who can pay for room and board. By not allowing students to apply for these benefits, the government is suggesting young people who attend college should have parents who help them more. Why is our system set up to only help those who don't go to college?

Or, only people with certain qualifications (PhD in public health) can become the appointed head of public health. Not sure how that would work in practice, but seems like a lot better for everyone. If prefer a multi-member district. Ranked choice might work to better multi member as well, creating a compromise legislature. This means expanded legislatures with districts of 3-4 seats. Legislatures of about 1 for every hundred thousand persons. You get local and varied representation. It eliminates most gerrymandering. For the Congress you could have a body of about 1000, making one every 300,000. This means every state has at least 2 representatives.

I wouldn't believe in it because I wouldn't have been told to think over it, and critique it, and see what you think about it. I can see what you're getting at but the argument doesn't hold. Because when science didn't exist everyone believed in religion. I also don't know which stories come up false. Also the standard isn't unknown. The simple standard is to do your best, and allow God into your life. You don't have to be perfect because it's impossible. Just say, ""yeah sure, I believe in you and will do my best"". Also although I can't say it's false, it's to simple to say ""either believe in me or you're going to hell"".

2526,"Basically the title, but I’ll explain my viewpoint and reasoning some more. Let me start by describing my background. I’m in my 50’s now, and I’ve been hunting pretty much my whole life. I started going with my grandpa and my uncles when I was young. I live in New Hampshire, and I’ve had a lot of experience hunting deer, turkey, and game birds. I have also hunted waterfowl, black bear, and moose, but not enough to consider myself experienced at it. You might be asking yourself what I mean when I say “done competently”. This is what I mean. I mean that the hunter only kills adult males, or adult females who do not have offspring that are dependent on them. I mean that the hunter is skilled enough and familiar enough with his or her weapon of choice to be able to hit the animal in the vital organs, killing it with minimal pain and suffering. I mean that a hunter should eat the animals that he or she kills, and should not just kill the animals to keep their antlers or hides as trophies. This should go without saying, but I also mean that the hunter has all the appropriate licenses, and follows all hunting laws, as well as the safety rules that relate to hunting and the use of firearms. When done competently, I think there is absolutely nothing cruel or unethical about hunting. The act of an animal killing and eating another animal for food is completely natural, and there is nothing wrong with it. I brought up the topic earlier of a hunter being skilled enough to shoot the animal in the vital organs.",What differentiate a good hunter from a bad hunter ?,clarity

However, to me it’s not right for someone to have to follow the rules of someone’s government without their choice. People can have groups and operate as they please and be happy to do so without others who feel forced. This would alleviate so much of the arguing that comes with living in a society where people disagree about the rules.

2529,"Had to take my last one down because of the wording. Before a patient is placed under a cocktail of drugs that effect their memory, there should be a direct proactive option for them to record it. It is understood these can be recorded upon request but this places physicians and staff at a level they feel personally attacked. It upsets some of them to a point they will not provide any additional services for comfort and recovery beyond what they are allowed to withhold. This is not an unusual request thrown into the mix that would be too tedious to add. This is an option that would benefit all patients in this scenario. They even proactively ask if sentimental jewelery is requested in the OR. And I also realize major operations are heavily monitored. But even the minor operations should be recorded for the patient, for a fee. You are taking away someone's memories. If someone reacts poorly to something because their comorbidities were overlooked or just ignored as irrelevant, this could easily be erased from their memories and not a word spoken of it. Any lapses of memory they do have from it, pushed aside as hallucinations. Some people do have conditions that make the setting of general anesthesia to be pretty traumatizing and many have no recollection. And no one speaks a word of it to maintain a cleaner record. And it just keeps happening. I believe most doctors are only doing what is best for the patient. But I also realize there are some that would rather drug the patient than admit fault. There are some that do not have the patients best interest at heart. This is important, this is your life vs someone's misplaced ego or direct carelessness for an alternative motive. Although I believe police are far more capable of direct malice than doctors, they do have body cams and a good handful have been known to physically do anything to stop the recording of themselves because it feels like a personal attack on them.",How will someone who is not medically trained be able to distinguish if harm was caused by something that appears to be an issue on the recording?,implication_consequences

I have only met one transgender in my entire life and my view is probably mostly based on this person, let's call her Lana, and on the transgenders you see on the television. Lana was male till the age of 19, where he told me he thought he was a girl. It was a very surreal moment for me, he had a huge beard and manly structure and there he sat, telling me he felt like he was a girl. I knew for sure he was joking (we had a habit of making fucked up jokes) so i bursted out in laughter. He told me again and added that he wanted to start progressing into a female. This was 7 years ago. I knew Lana has been dealing with mental illness her entire life. She had a very rough childhood due to undiagnosed autism, adhd and depression. For some reason I connected that in my head to her becoming a transgender She had undiagnosed problems and concluded that she didn't fit in because she wasn't in the right body. Writing this out makes my face turn red a little because i know thoughts like these are heavily frowned upon, but it is what i currently truely believe.
